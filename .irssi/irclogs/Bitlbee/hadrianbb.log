02:48 playahater| i fucked up my sleeping timing again .. 
02:48 playahater| :/
02:48 hadrianbb| ah... well, me too, kinda
02:48 playahater| kindof desoriented .. :)
02:48 hadrianbb| i actually went to sleep early last night and stared at the ceiling from bed until 8 o clock in the morning
02:49 playahater| lol .. not bad .. :) .. 
02:50 playahater| have you been looking at swap lately?
02:50 hadrianbb| no... was leaving you on it... 
02:50 hadrianbb| but i saw that player is working!
02:51 playahater| there`s mediamover and some fileds left to do .. and then comes templateing and design on the stage :) ..
02:51 hadrianbb| :)
02:52 hadrianbb| as i understood it... you guys are on conversion and fields... and then we meet to rock this shit
02:52 hadrianbb| yes?
02:53 playahater| yup ..
02:53 playahater| :)
02:53 hadrianbb| so i wait you guys shout (please don't hesitate)
02:54 playahater| you can do episode and station templateing while we do conversion ..
02:54 playahater| and series ..
02:54 playahater| :)
02:54 playahater| i made all temaplate files ..
02:54 hadrianbb| they are out of blocks?
02:55 playahater| some blocks are still there but printed directly from tempalate ..
02:55 playahater| you`ll see ..
02:55 playahater| :)
02:55 playahater| scream if you get stuck .. :) ..
02:55 hadrianbb| ok... or think it's better we meet to put back into the sauce...
02:56 hadrianbb| will go back into it and see
02:56 hadrianbb| last two days have been building a website for faculty theory group...
02:56 playahater| ouh .. :) ..
02:56 playahater| drupal?
02:56 playahater| :)
02:56 hadrianbb| gave myself couple days...
02:56 playahater| ;)
02:57 hadrianbb| well at first, i thought that i had enough of drupal and would go wordpress
02:57 hadrianbb| idea was to take a cms i don't know much about, do a quick theme and that's it
02:57 playahater| naaahhh .. wordpress .. too commercial ..
02:57 hadrianbb| no man... drupal is...
02:57 playahater| aa .. that`s acceptable reason .. :)
02:58 hadrianbb| anyways... wordpress has a pretty beautifull interface...
02:58 hadrianbb| and a day or two of that...
02:58 hadrianbb| then...
02:58 playahater| i presume .. :)
02:58 hadrianbb| drupal
02:58 hadrianbb| i started yesterday with it
02:59 hadrianbb| and am actually rocking, well that's the feeling...
02:59 hadrianbb| fusion template, "just clicking" restrictions...
02:59 hadrianbb| very happy so far
02:59 playahater| cought a nice wave .. 
02:59 playahater| ql ..
02:59 playahater| nice ..
02:59 playahater| :)
02:59 hadrianbb| yes.. that's exaclty it
03:00 hadrianbb| so i got into views a bit... amazing stuff
03:00 playahater| you can`t imagine .. :)
03:00 hadrianbb| and feeds module... it's actually a import module.. with a...
03:00 hadrianbb| parser!
03:00 playahater| smth like that ..
03:00 playahater| :)
03:01 hadrianbb| i managed to import tags from a tkh feed, quite cool
03:01 playahater| i was looking at swap design .. and i must say .. hmm .. me like white .. :) .. 
03:02 playahater| whith those blocks .. :)
03:02 playahater| and fancy ajax .. :)
03:02 hadrianbb| once with all the tech settled done, i will bash out some paint... i like it white too ;)
03:03 playahater| hehe
03:03 hadrianbb| so for the site am on... will have some questions or help needed...
03:03 hadrianbb| (28modules installed...)
03:04 playahater| wordpress with 28 modules?
03:04 hadrianbb| no man, drupal
03:04 playahater| swap?
03:04 playahater| :)
03:04 hadrianbb| aah... no, the site for the theory group
03:04 hadrianbb| called soba46
03:04 playahater| didn`t you say you used wp for that?
03:04 hadrianbb| will show you
03:05 playahater| nahh .. no matter .. continue .. :)
03:05 hadrianbb| yes, used for a day, then went full drupal
03:05 hadrianbb| used wp for a day
03:05 playahater| aaa .. ql .. 
03:05 playahater| :)
03:05 playahater| nice ..
03:05 playahater| go on ..
03:05 playahater| :)
03:06 hadrianbb| had some question/issues/decision to take... don't want to make design mistake
03:06 hadrianbb| i mean by design... conceptual architecture of the site
03:06 playahater| yeah .. ql .. 
03:06 playahater| no problem ..
03:07 hadrianbb| kool :)
03:07 playahater| ;)
03:07 hadrianbb| the site will also be opening a door towards faculty instiutions... will see...
03:08 playahater| ql .. nice place for drupal .. :) ..
03:09 hadrianbb| allow me just a simple question:
03:09 playahater| shoot
03:09 playahater| :)
03:09 hadrianbb| i understand "book" can be used as a form of wiki...
03:09 hadrianbb| a book of (wiki) page
03:09 hadrianbb| just that it doesn't have wiki markup etc
03:10 playahater| yup .. smth like that ..
03:10 hadrianbb| yup
03:10 playahater| you can create parent and child nodes ..
03:10 playahater| .. and there`s a wiki module also .. ;)
03:11 hadrianbb| yes... and it's content is seperate?
03:11 hadrianbb| for example: a tag1 in the wiki module and a tag1 in drupal content are the same?
03:12 playahater| think so .. you`d have to try .. didn`t see book for a long time .. :) ..
03:13 hadrianbb| that's what i thought... you deal with child/parent relation thourgh views?
03:13 playahater| or directly from database .. :)
03:13 hadrianbb| pff
03:13 playahater| depends .. :)
03:13 hadrianbb| yes
03:14 hadrianbb| mmmh... will have to show and talk about it
03:14 hadrianbb| +you
03:14 playahater| that could be more productive .. :)
03:14 hadrianbb| yes :)
03:15 playahater| subota .. 18h .. :) .. razmena pa znd .. :) ..
03:15 playahater| green?
03:15 playahater| :)

16:13 playahater| yo .. :)
16:14 playahater| we`ll be in znd around 21h ..
16:15 hadrianbb| are u going there to work tonight or just to meet with me?
16:16 playahater| since we`re meeting at 21h .. we`ll be working from home .. and meet u at 21 .. 
16:16 playahater| but tomorrow .. you and i can meet and work together ..
16:17 playahater| marko has configured the computing env here at home .. and it`s pain to adapt at znd .. 
16:18 playahater| until the new laptop solution arrives .. 
16:18 playahater| :)
16:20 playahater| so .. is that ok? .. we meet for a cup of talk at znd around 21h .. and you and i can a arrange a working session for tomorrow ..
16:21 hadrianbb| i don't know Z...
16:21 hadrianbb| if location is an issue, i can come to your place
16:21 hadrianbb| but to meet tonight and just discuss is a waste of time i think
16:22 hadrianbb| like we will discuss what we will do tomorrow
16:22 hadrianbb| we can discuss that here or over the phone then
16:22 hadrianbb| ...
16:23 playahater| well .. i agree .. i thought that the meeting was scheduled because of your meeting with denis .. 
16:24 hadrianbb| mmh... the point is more that we have something working, rather than me saying to denis another new deadline for a workable website...
16:25 playahater| well .. concerning the features .. we are left with optimization and database import ..
16:25 hadrianbb| i think that if the template of episode, station and series are how they looked like, that would already be good
16:25 hadrianbb| and that shouldn't take you much time
16:25 playahater| and of course .. some template arangement and css
16:26 hadrianbb| i am saying you because you know best and to place them in the sense that you have been in the code
16:26 hadrianbb| what do you mean by optimisation?
16:26 hadrianbb| more precisecly?
16:27 playahater| optimizing database tables .. cacheing the php bytecode .. cache drupal and apache .. 
16:27 playahater| long story short .. speeding up the swap
16:27 playahater| :)
16:27 hadrianbb| well, that's not going to happen before wednesday
16:28 hadrianbb| if we can play audio and upload/create episode it's ok
16:28 playahater| yeah .. that`s working ..
16:29 hadrianbb| so, episode, station page are just out of template/css?
16:29 hadrianbb| i mean looking shit
16:30 playahater| yes .. there`s practicly only templateing left 
16:30 playahater| episode, station, series and user page ..
16:30 hadrianbb| ah man... why don't you place nicely, it's about three lines of code and you were there...
16:31 hadrianbb| need to be a bit more organic in the doing... 
16:31 playahater| almost everything is printed .. divs are left to be arranged and some css ..
16:31 playahater| i can do that arrangement ..
16:32 playahater| just don`t know the "proper" order :) ..
16:32 playahater| well .. my bank is going to get closed .. it`s working until 17h .. 
16:32 playahater| i`ll be back in 15-20 min ..
16:33 hadrianbb| i"ll check the template now
16:33 playahater| page you on chat when i`m back ..
16:33 hadrianbb| ok, c u

17:22 hadrianbb| episode and station page done; quick and dirty
17:23 hadrianbb| tagedelic block doesn't refer the right tags in episode
17:26 playahater| yo yo yo .. :) .. i`m back ..
17:27 hadrianbb| ql
17:27 playahater| tagadelic block is not suppose to print tags from the episode  .. but globaly pull random/some/popular tags from the database .. 
17:28 playahater| that`s why are tags for episode printed directly from the template using that "for loop"
17:29 hadrianbb| mhh... actually i think tagadelic can print content related tags
17:30 playahater| maybe there a settings for that .. 
17:30 hadrianbb| more exactly node related tags...
17:30 playahater| let me check
17:34 playahater| nope .. no those kind of settings in tagadelic ..
17:34 playahater| tagadelic pulls the tags from the database and prints them in the block .. 
17:35 hadrianbb| there was a drupal block there from tagadelic, no?
17:35 playahater| you can choose sort order and number of tags
17:35 hadrianbb| in the episode-region configuration
17:38 playahater| yup .. but it`s views`s block for tagadelic ..
17:39 playahater| tagadelic is doing what it`s suppose to .. episode tags are printed from template .. iow .. no problem .. :) .. 
17:44 hadrianbb| am running to class
17:44 hadrianbb| back around 20
17:44 hadrianbb| will carry on templating tonight
17:44 hadrianbb| how's the player loading your cpu?
17:44 hadrianbb| mine is a quite high
17:47 playahater| well .. yes .. around 50% .. 
17:47 playahater| not so low .. 
17:47 playahater| anyways .. quick question .. 
17:48 playahater| there is no need for us to have a meeting today just because of you meeting with denis ?
17:48 playahater| the idea is to have this done asap ?
17:48 hadrianbb| no, let's not meet tonight
17:49 hadrianbb| with denis, he and I will discuss of everything
17:49 hadrianbb| and plate-form
17:49 hadrianbb| and i think it's time that brush things up, and get the site going
17:49 hadrianbb| towards the beta
17:50 hadrianbb| regardless of meeting, we are now really behind schedule...
17:50 playahater| we can work today from home .. and meet tomorrow .. at least you and I .. and finish templating ..
17:50 hadrianbb| and project is taking a set back from that
17:50 hadrianbb| yes
17:51 hadrianbb| am sorry but i can't protect from pressure anymore
17:51 hadrianbb| we all have to go further, get paid, etc
17:52 playahater| i completely agree .. we should be finishing this off very soon .. we`ll talk about that tomorrow when we see each other ..
17:52 playahater| :)
17:52 hadrianbb| so, i will work when get back from soon
17:52 hadrianbb| school
17:52 playahater| ok ..
17:53 hadrianbb| "very soon" was "one month ago"
17:53 hadrianbb| we need to understand that, we don't have excuses...
17:54 hadrianbb| there are always some we can find, but i don't want to play that game anymore
17:54 hadrianbb| and to add:
17:54 hadrianbb| that we had budget, and have already been paid some of it
17:54 hadrianbb| we should honor our oblogations
17:54 hadrianbb| towards ourselves
17:55 playahater| i understand that .. 
17:56 playahater| .. but .. we`ll talk about that tomorrow .. :) ..
17:57 playahater| a lot of stuff has been added .. moded .. removed .. and we`re at the point where everything should be optimized and lounched ..
17:58 playahater| anyways .. we`ll see each other tomorrow .. and do swaping from home today ..
17:58 playahater| what time tomorrow at znd suits you ?

14:28 hadrianbb| question:
14:29 hadrianbb| i would like to to make teaser for episode from views like i did with stations directory page
14:29 hadrianbb| but it picks up always episode-teaser.php
14:30 hadrianbb| when i remove episode-teaser.php, it gives me error
14:30 hadrianbb| so...
14:30 hadrianbb| any idea?
14:32 playahater| great .. it works .. :) .. 
14:32 playahater| if you choose to print a teaser from views ..
14:33 playahater| and you define a teaser tpl.php file ..
14:33 playahater| if drupal can`t find that teaser .. it will throw up an error ..
14:35 hadrianbb| mmh
14:35 hadrianbb| ok
14:36 hadrianbb| (fucking teasers)
