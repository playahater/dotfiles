19:59  pielgrzym| hgabreu: hgabreu I'm lost with this haskell constructors stuff :( I tried inserting this after $ sublayout in myLayout hoot but it seems to complain about '='
19:59          --> comak has joined
20:00  hgabreu| pielgrzym: hum.. easiest thing to do is place it at the end of your config or somewhere neutral: a line like this:
20:00  pielgrzym| http://wklej.org/id/289152/
20:01  hgabreu| mySubTabbed x = addTabs shrinkText myTheme $ subLayout [] Simplest x
20:01  hgabreu| pielgrzym: then use 'mySubTabbed' where you used subTabbed
20:01  pielgrzym| I'm a python programmer for almost 3 years, after reading haskell book on wikibook I still feel like I know and understand absolutely nothing about this (fascinating, but very hard) language :(
20:01          * og01 is the same
20:01  hgabreu| and use <yourTheme> instead of 'myTheme'
20:02  pielgrzym| hgabreu: thanks :)
20:03  Alpounet| pielgrzym, it requires some time to get used to
20:03  Alpounet| but is in my opinion worth that time
20:04  pielgrzym| Alpounet: I really like it, but there's almost no literature on the subject :( btw. is Haskell a fully low level language (not exactly low-level, low level like c/fortran etc)? or rather something closer to ruby/pytnon?
20:04  Alpounet| it's higher level than ruby/python, even
20:04  Alpounet| but let's you do very pretty things with efficiency
20:05  Alpounet| the better example being probably xmonad
20:05  pielgrzym| hgabreu: xmonad.hs:82:24: parse error on input `=' - should I put the mySubTabbed x somewhere outside myLayout, shouldn't I?
20:05  Alpounet| pielgrzym, there is less litterature than for C++, Java and all
20:05  Alpounet| but still, there is quite much
20:05  Alpounet| @where rwh
20:05 +lambdabot| http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/ http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/
20:05  hgabreu| pielgrzym: this should do http://wklej.org/id/289155/
20:05  Alpounet| @where lyag
20:05 +lambdabot| I know nothing about lyag.
20:05  Alpounet| @where lyah
20:05 +lambdabot| http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/
20:05  Alpounet| etc
20:06  pielgrzym| hgabreu: aaaaah, now I get it :) thanks :)
20:06  pielgrzym| Alpounet: any printed stuff? :)
20:06  og01| ok guys - i've just been called out to work
20:06  Alpounet| pielgrzym, the first one
20:06  og01| tux_mark_5: i'll give you a shout later
20:06  Alpounet| there is a printed book version of it
20:06  Alpounet| on amazon and all
20:06  Alpounet| published at O'Reilly, IIRC
20:06  pielgrzym| Alpounet: ah, indeed :) how come it is higher level than python and seems so much snappier?
20:07  Alpounet| pielgrzym, it seems so to you probably because of your xmonad experience
20:08  Alpounet| but people usually just see how haskell is low level when they learn it
20:08  Alpounet| high level*

20:08  pielgrzym| damn, got one problem with the tabs now :(
20:09  pielgrzym| when I swap workspaces on screens the tabs remain on previous screen :(
20:10  pielgrzym| I have two monitors
20:11  pielgrzym| If I try to switch to workspace visible on other screen they get swapped :) but if the workspace had tabs too then they remain on previous screen :/

20:16  pielgrzym| hgabreu: can I just use this subLayout feature as a layout type? so I can switch to it explicitly?
20:18  gwern| interesting. now [[dwm]] is up for deletion
20:19          * gwern wonders whether to try to help it
20:24  Entroacceptor| I thought only the german wikipedia was this deletion-friendly
20:25  gwern| Entroacceptor: there's a particular editor who goes after FLOSS articles
20:25  gwern| he's been working through wm articles
20:26          --> bo0ts__ has joined
20:26  gwern| en is very tolerant; it's also very tolerant of the intolerant
20:26  gwern| that's how articles can exist for years only to fall to the first deletionist to get annoyed by it
20:27  pielgrzym| I keep having problems with subLayout :( the other layout that by default is tabbed gains extra tabbed before name, I think it's this double declaration/incantation that is the problem :)
