16:35          --> smitty519 has joined
16:36  keystr0k| Yvier6:  I think that depends on where you're calling it...   if the $title variable exists, it'll print whatever that is... which I think will work in a normal .tpl.php file.    To show the title in contemplate templates, you'd use   $node->title

16:51  keystr0k| dpm($content_profile);
16:51  keystr0k| it'll show you the entire structure of that object

16:58          --> roccs- has joined
17:00  lazysoundsystem| keystr0k: no, i think you did - I got the url and can print it out using normal html - i just can't get imagecache to work with this field
17:00  keystr0k| I see. I typically use that function...   
17:00  keystr0k| and feed it the preset name and filepath
17:00  keystr0k| and set the results as a variable that I then use as my image src
17:01  lazysoundsystem| using the base filepath?
17:01          <-- cerpy has quit irc
17:01          <-- Badger has quit irc
17:01  keystr0k| Yeah, the idea is that you feed that function the path to the image, and it returns a path to the imagecache version of the image
17:02  lazysoundsystem| but without calling imagecache the picture doesn't get cached at the size i want.
17:02  keystr0k| lazysoundsystem:  hmmm.

18:01  Irishgringo| repeating question... if I want to add a JQuery library... jqtouch, in drupal is there a prescribed method... should it be done in a module? the theme? or is there a module that allows me to add plugins.... other wise I am going to have to hardcode this...
18:02  nitrospectide| i want to set up a view where the filter looks to see if a field value is less than another field value. the first value - i can pick the field from a list. on the second i need to put in a value. can i reference the field somehow?

18:02  fakingfantastic| is there a way to put text after a webform?
18:03  beautifulmind| Irishgringo: well, if the libreay act as a part of the them, you need to copy it to the theme's directory and link it to page.tpl.php and other templates you have craeted
18:03  beautifulmind| fakingfantastic: use hook_form_alter() or hook_form_FORM_ID_alter()
18:04  skh_| Irishgringo: a better way would be to add it to your theme's .info file, or even better, if you only need it at certain times, use drupal_add_js in the function(s)
18:04  skh_| shouldn't be adding resources directly in your tpl's
18:04  Irishgringo| skh_: that sounds like a good idea...
18:05  beautifulmind| Irishgringo: yeah that's a better way
18:05  Irishgringo| i was planning on creating some <secret> pages that only iPhones can see...
18:05  beautifulmind| if you are using 6.x 
18:05  Irishgringo| I am using d6

18:12  Irishgringo| well, I think the mobileplugin module, requires a theme for mobile devices.  I just want to create custom node.tpl.php that call custom page.tpl.php ...  and mobileplugin looks a little dated...  all in all, being an iphone developer...  I dont particluarly like this strategy

18:17  Irishgringo| I appreciate the help..   but I need core features of the phones...  appcelerator, coredata... stuff like that... so a pure html is the problem.   but the growl stuff I will look at more.  also looking at the mobile plugin stuff now....  
18:17  G_S| if I want to take a user's ability to edit post settings away, what permission is that?
18:18          --> lukus has joined
18:18  skh_| 'edit own posts' or something similar
18:18          --> RCube has joined
18:19  Irishgringo| i think I am going to have to theme some views pages directly... and include the jqtouch library as you suggested   .
18:19          <-- tobiassjosten has quit irc
18:19  indytechcook| Irishgringo: your best bet might be to user the services module to communicate between a iphone app and drupal
18:20  PatMac| What is the name of the module that breaks each node down into being visible by a role?
18:20  Irishgringo| indytechcook: I have not been able to figure out the services module well... and I am told that I should wait until services 3 comes out in 2 months...
18:21  Irishgringo| but I need examples to figure stuff out... and I just could not find any... but you are right about services

18:29  Irishgringo| perhaps I should explain why I want to use the jqtouch libraries...   it gives me some webkit features that look like native iphone table stuff...  and it will render on other smartphones the same way... which I think is pretty cool.
18:29          --> macode has joined
18:31  Irishgringo| another question... that is probably best done in services..  but i could also accept a compiled plist as well...   which would just be generated every couple hours and put on a cache server somewhere...   so a combination of a cron job and generating the list from a view...  if anyone has some sugestions there?

18:48  foo| Looks like the "split at cursor" option is broke with wysiwyg api + tinymce. I used <!--break--> ... but views doesn't know how to filter it out. I'm going to write a views template file to strip it out unless anyone has a better idea.
18:49  duran| I'm trying to build a zen sub-theme.   and the left sidebar region isn't displaying...   anyone see this before?  am I missing something obvious?
18:49  duran| I have blocks in that region
18:49          <-- Crash1hd has quit irc
18:50  duran| G_S: you have to modify roles, I'm not sure what permission level changes that, but you have to start with minimal rights, and go up from there.
18:50  skh_| duran: may be a silly question, but those blocks are displaying something right?
18:50  lava| hi foo 
18:51          <-- johsw has quit irc
18:51  duran| yes, there are things in the blocks
18:51  foo| lava: howdy :)
18:51  duran| I'm moving from a hacked garland theme, to zen.
18:51  duran| and I've "moved' the blocks to other regions (content) and they show up
18:51  skh_| what about on the blocks overview page, do they show there?
18:51  duran| no
18:52  duran| in fact the "yellow" bars that show where the regions are, aren't showing up
18:52  duran| its just the left and right areas
18:52  e621| hi!
18:52  Druplicon| que tal
18:52  Druplicon|  e621 is great
18:52  duran| the section of page.tpl that is ...         <?php if ($left): ?>
18:52  duran|   isn't showing anything
18:52  e621| I was doing this: http://www.kirkdesigns.co.uk/drupal-6-how-embed-region-node
18:52  e621| to add a region in my zen theme
18:53  e621| function zen_preprocess_node(&$vars, $hook) {
18:53  skh_| duran: what about if you use the base zen theme, does it work
18:53  e621| $vars['prop_images'] = theme('blocks', 'prop_images');
18:53  e621| }
18:53  e621| I added this, and all blew up

18:54  e621| my bad
18:54  duran| So, when I set to the default ZEN theme, the sidebars show up
18:54  e621| thanks!
18:55  skh_| np
18:55  e621| right
18:55  e621| so I add the new region
18:55  e621| inside the previous functions
18:55          <-- bleen has quit irc
18:55  skh_| duran: my guess is either that you changed your .tpl file, or missed renaming the "SUBTHEME" text somewhere

18:55  Druplicon| hey
18:55  machine1| whats up
18:55  machine1| salut
18:56  duran| yeah, looking for that STARTERKIT somewhere.
18:56  skh_| grep -r STARTERKIT . ftw =)
18:56  duran| I'll also copy the page.tpl from zen to my subtheme/templates directory, again
18:56  e621| ok!

18:57  e621| thank you skh
18:57  e621| I copied the code inside the existing function
18:58  e621| and it didn't explode
18:58  skh_| e621: as a side note, i see you're editing the base zen theme, you should take a look at creating a zen subtheme if you wanna do it the way you're supposed it
18:58  duran| well

18:58  e621| :(
18:58  duran| but thats to be expected :)

18:58  skh_| e621: not hard to fix, just move your customizations into the starterkit, rename, then redownload the base

04:20  hefox| if you want
