06:30  d3m0n3| domX: sure
06:30  shadowdaemon| only need one grub install
06:30  d3m0n3| domX: u need a boot partiton
06:30  d3m0n3| debian not have it
06:31  pickledpiper| no... you don't need a boot partition.
06:31  d3m0n3| u must invert your os
06:31  Luther| domX, d3m0n3 actually invented gentoo in his dorm room back in college...so ask him anything. he has all the answers

06:32  domX| and I am installing gentoo on /dev/sdb with /dev/sdb1 as /boot and /dev/sdb2 as /
06:33  pickledpiper| sounds fine
06:33  pickledpiper| should work domX
06:33  d3m0n3| invert your hd this is the quickly way
06:33  domX| usually I install gentoo on sda/hda, never had this issue

06:33          <-- tejing has left
06:33  domX| but it is there
06:34  Luther| pickledpiper / d3m0n3 I got another question: On re-boot, I am gonna assume that all this work is gonna go down the toilet, so how can I set it up so it first looks for : eth0, then wlan1, then wlan0 in sequence and brings whatever is connected/turned on up without problems on bootup
06:34  shadowdaemon| Luther: /etc/conf.d/net
06:34  pickledpiper| hold on domX, you already have a /boot partition on /dev/sda yeah?
06:35  pickledpiper| maybe /dev/sda1?
06:35  domX| yeah, but that one shall be erased together with debian later
06:35  domX| as soon as gentoo is running fine
06:35  d3m0n3| u must set static ip
06:36  Luther| shadowdaemon, this is what I have now : http://dpaste.com/166761/
06:36  domX| could I just edit menu.lst from debians /boot d3m0n3 ?

06:36  andares| Hey guys, I have no idea what's happening.
06:36  shadowdaemon| Luther: also /etc/conf.d/rc
06:36  domX| debian is amd64 2.6.26, gentoo is amd64 no-multilib 2.6.32
06:36  andares| For some reason, a lot of things on my system seem redirected to /dev/null.

06:44  pickledpiper| Problem with changing priority is that your drive associations may change domX.  you will need to be very careful to check your partitions before you install Gentoo otherwise you may end up overwriting debian
06:44  andares| Also unix_checkpwd is giving a GENERAL PROTECTION FAULT.

06:44  andares| shadowdaemon: uh.. what? No, no, a lot of programs seem to be trying to manipulate /dev/null for some reason.
06:44  pickledpiper| n.b. sda becomes sdb and sdb becomes sda.
06:45  andares| shadowdaemon: as in, I installed qpsmtpd and it broke my system somehow that's causing a lot of programs to try to read /dev/null.

06:49  pickledpiper| Luther did you actually have a DHCP server on that network?

I have heard many good things and worked with a few other distrobutions in the past.

06:59  pickledpiper| yup.

07:43  shentino| I suppose I should ask, which one is further from "mere mortal users" in terms of technical expertise required to manage?
07:43  Luther| shentino, whats geekier? slack , gentoo or linux from scratch ?
07:43  d3m0n3| shentino: both? to slackware are simple to install but it has many operations post conf gentoo is more complex to install but once made it does not have problems
07:43          --> harpal has joined
07:43  shadowdaemon| question is: which distro allows most flexibility AND ease-of-use?
07:43  Luther| or two broken circuit boards , one wire , dead camel in the middle of the serengetti
07:44  Luther| thats pretty hardcore geeky
07:44  shadowdaemon| Luther: dead camel in the middle of the serengetti
07:44  Luther| shadowdaemon, ... shentino 's questions pretty good though to be honest :p
07:44  shadowdaemon| Luther: true, it is a discussion point

07:48  Satoru-san| how do I eclean distfiles?
07:48  dividebyzer0| ^^if you can get it installed
07:48  Satoru-san| I am out of space :P
07:48  Luther| yea
07:49  itdocks| once you install gentoo a couple of times you don't even need the manual anymore
07:49  Satoru-san| itdocks: yes.
07:49  shadowdaemon| Satoru-san: I would say 'man eclean' but your man pages are not working
07:49  itdocks| or you can just clone another machine you have
07:49  Satoru-san| yea.
07:49  Luther| see that? if you asked Satoru-san 's question (how do I eclean distfiles?) from some random dude on the street, i bet $100 he'll get shot,..

07:52  Satoru-san| all I have to do is whereis eclean | bzip -cd `awk '{pring $2}'`
07:52  dividebyzer0| itdocks: maybe one day I'll be able to get through the install lol
07:52  Satoru-san| wait no..
07:53  itdocks| it feels great to get through the install for the first time
07:53  Luther| itdock, I always wondered if gentoo even fit in such environment...care to give me a brief 2 line summary how how gentoo fits in?
07:53  shadowdaemon| Satoru-san: maybe you need two gentoo systems? one is in your native language, one is in japanese?
07:53  Satoru-san| bzip -cd `whereis eclean | awk '{pring $2}'

16:12  [biabia]| reading the help docs for setting USE flags during installation is not helping me much.  This is my first install and not really sure which USE flags to put in make.conf
16:13 @bonsaikitten| [biabia]: if in doubt leave defaults
16:13          --> misterjack has joined
16:13  hangfire| [biabia]: You'll probably be fine with mostly defaults to start - if you've picked gnome or kde, then set one or the other
16:13  [biabia]| defaults are 'mmx sse sse2
16:13  iamben| [biabia]: those are not defaults, defaults are set by your profile... check emerge --info
16:13  [biabia]| hmm ok
16:13  geo27_| hangfire: thanks for your answer. here is what I get after having loaded the rt73usb module. There is something to merge ? I would have guessed that all was provided by the kernel itself. I'll check that !
16:14  kaushal| iamben: is it correct now http://paste.ubuntu.com/387036/ ?
16:14  jmrk_| kaushal: yes
16:14  iamben| kaushal: yeah, now you just need to remerge it
16:14  kaushal| so emerge -av php ?
16:14  jmrk_| yes
16:14  kaushal| sure

16:14  qdii| sorry for not answerring, and thanks for the modifications :)
16:14  kaushal| jmrk_: let me update you
16:15  hangfire| geo27_: Yes, you need the rt2X00 kernel driver (modular or otherwise) and the firmware image merged
16:15  kaushal| iamben: thanks
16:15  kaushal| iamben: i will update you
16:15          --> tresh has joined

16:15  hangfire| geo27_: did you mean to paste a link?
16:15  geo27_| hangfire: oh. Thanks for this, I didn't know for the firmware part. I'll merge this right now.
16:16  geo27_| http://pastebin.com/MPjCsAPE here is the link that didn't follow the copy/paste process.
16:16  hangfire| geo27_: only if it's actually a rt73 card ;)

16:17  hangfire| geo27_: tbh, that looks like it's working already - are you sure that there isn' anything else before that?
16:17          <-- gutts has quit irc
16:18  geo27_| hangfire: no, nothing more before or after that. And ifconfig and iwconfig only report lo and eth0 interfaces, nothing for my usb device.
16:18  hangfire| geo27_: ifconfig -a

16:20  [biabia]| iamben it shows bash: emerge: command not found   (im at the step in installation right before chrooting)
16:20  hangfire| geo27_: you're lucky - I was just getting my rt61 working yesterday ;)  (it went pretty smoothly though)
16:20 @bonsaikitten| [biabia]: the livecd environment has no emerge available
16:20  geo27_| hangfire: ifconfig -a shows only lo and eht0, nothing more.
16:20  hangfire| bonsaikitten: doesn't it? Is that a new thing?
