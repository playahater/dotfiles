07:07  jacine| dialog is in... page rules are in, i am writing an announcement looking for testers.. shit is lookin HAWT! :P
07:08  jacine| looks like drupal 7, huh ;)
07:08  stephthegeek| YAY!  i saw the unfuddle update
07:08  stephthegeek| i LOVE the icons, nice job!!
07:08  jacine| oh ha! :)
07:08  jacine| i forget you are in there.. :) LOL
07:08  stephthegeek| it's ok i had no idea what it really was  :)
07:08  stephthegeek| this is D6 though?
07:08  jacine| I just need some markdown preview
07:08  jacine| yes it is!
07:09  jacine| we stole contextual links code.
07:09  stephthegeek| oh man nice job on the outlines
07:09  jacine| totally stolen
07:09  jacine| you see the page rules.
07:09  jacine| top right?
07:09  stephthegeek| hang on hang on.. hehe
07:09  jacine| :P
07:09  stephthegeek| oooooooooooo
07:09  jacine| you should make an account :)
07:09  stephthegeek| god that's sexy
07:09          * stephthegeek wipes tear
07:09  jacine| did you look at the page rules yet?
07:10  stephthegeek| YES
07:10  jacine| oh ok :)
07:10  jacine| total hotness
07:10          * stephthegeek is in ur website, changin ur skinz
07:10  jacine| LOL
07:13  jacine| stephthegeek: Bala even ported most of the new stuff to D7 already.
07:13  stephthegeek| dayum
07:13  jacine| stephthegeek: I am so happy.
07:13  stephthegeek| i am swooning
07:13  jacine| v1 was ported... but no page rules
07:13  jacine| now they are there :) only thing missing is dialog
07:13  jacine| but it works w/overlay.
07:14  stephthegeek| awesome
07:14  jacine| I had to tell you :) no one else really cares. haha
07:14  stephthegeek| chris is neck deep in a closet right now but i will show him in a few too
07:14  jacine| LOL get him out! :P
07:14  jacine| haha
07:15  jacine| kidding :)
07:15  stephthegeek| hehe he's digging out info for my citizenship application, important stuff  :P

07:17          <-- sarah_p has left
07:28  stephthegeek| jacine, i'm curious about the text in the dropdown on the gear icon
07:28  jacine| oh?
07:28  stephthegeek| why not have that open the dialog directly?  are you planning to have that show in the list which styles are applied?
07:29  jacine| no, we want it like contextual links
07:29  jacine| i was telling bala it would be nice to get rid of the stuff you guys have to do, and just add the configure block/menu links in there.
07:29          * stephthegeek is woefully behind on that new drupal hotness  :(
07:30  jacine| yeah, that's how it is... I like it :)
07:30  stephthegeek| okay.  so that's specifically a D7 thing
07:30  jacine| I think it's cleaner than having a bunch of links end up there.
07:30  stephthegeek| but.. backported in skinr for D6?
07:30  jacine| sort of
07:30  stephthegeek| oh i agree, just trying to grok the bigger picture of it
07:30          <-- emmajane has quit irc
07:30  jacine| not really though... just stolen functionality.
07:31  stephthegeek| ok but on D7, you'd have the other links in there?
07:31  jacine| He told me contextual links should be backported.  I don't disagree.
07:31  jacine| yeah, wanna see?
07:31  stephthegeek| sure  :)
07:31  jacine| http://sky.d7.graviteklabs.com/
07:31  jacine| make an account there
07:32  jacine| actually, nevermind maybe i can just give you permission
07:32  stephthegeek| made account already  :)
07:32  jacine| oh :)
07:32  jacine| ok, reload
07:33  stephthegeek| aha
07:33  stephthegeek| hehe this is going to be the most substantial experience i've had with D7 so far
07:33  jacine| that version of skinr isn't totally up to date, but you get the gist.
07:33  jacine| LOL
07:33          * stephthegeek is soooo looking forward to being done school in 2.5 months
07:33  jacine| done for good?
07:33  stephthegeek| yeah
07:33  jacine| nice!
07:34  stephthegeek| well who knows, maybe i'll collect another degree in a decade  :P
07:34  jacine| haha :)
07:34  jacine| I have the overlay off on this site :P
07:34  stephthegeek| hah
07:34  jacine| but usually clicking those would open it... until we finish the dialog port.
07:34  stephthegeek| right
07:35  stephthegeek| i have kept up on the overlay debate..
07:35  jacine| yeah :(
07:35  stephthegeek| basically i'm only up to date on that stuff because i read issue queues in class  :P
07:35  jacine| LOL
07:35  jacine| bad stephthegeek, bad.
07:35  stephthegeek| :D
07:35  stephthegeek| what's the status of image previews?
07:35  jacine| low on the list :P
07:35  jacine| we are running out of bala time soon.
07:36  jacine| he just did an admin listing page, showing all skinr settings on one page.
07:36  stephthegeek| oh that's cool
07:36  stephthegeek| but aww for the previews
07:36  jacine| and I want this one, big time: http://drupal.org/node/691464
07:36  Druplicon| http://drupal.org/node/691464 => Filter classes for different view styles. => Skinr, Code, normal, needs work, 3 comments, 3 IRC mentions
07:36  stephthegeek| can we help with that?
07:36  jacine| yeah, why not :)
07:37  stephthegeek| we have some crazy shit in fusion i'd LOVE to get out if previews can get in skinr
07:37  stephthegeek| the whole base theme/subtheme path stuff
07:37  jacine| we are not doing serious previews though.
07:37  stephthegeek| does not make for niceness
07:37  stephthegeek| serious previous?  haha.. what is that?
07:37  jacine| well, like panels previews and crap.
07:37  jacine| what you do in fusion is about as far as we'd take it
07:37  stephthegeek| i'm just talking about like what's in fusion now, the ability to specify a screenshot in the info file to show on hover
07:37  stephthegeek| yeah for sure
07:37  jacine| anything else would be nuts.
07:38  jacine| someone asked for that
07:38  stephthegeek| ah yeah, more theme hooks would be good for view types, etc.
07:38  stephthegeek| heh yeah
07:38  jacine| yeah, i want that for lists.
07:38          --> Bevan_ has joined
07:38  stephthegeek| yeah.  although most of the stuff we do for lists now we do on .views-rows too
07:38  jacine| yeah but it's good for reducing clutter.
07:39  stephthegeek| yep
07:39  stephthegeek| that would be nice  :)
07:39  jacine| yeah
07:39  stephthegeek| too many list styles and stuff
07:39  stephthegeek| hmm could you restrict to a specific block even?  like user login block?  not sure how far you guys are thinking of taking that...
07:39  jacine| well, not that far
07:39  jacine| but block_user would work
07:39  stephthegeek| so are you looking at just making it generic for the hooks?
07:40  jacine| yes
07:40  stephthegeek| oooooOOOooooo
07:40  stephthegeek| smart.
07:40  jacine| I want to rename feature to hook...
07:40  jacine| but it's kinda late.
07:40  stephthegeek| yeah.. but i think that can be taken care of in docs.
07:40  jacine| yeah
07:41  stephthegeek| maybe rename that in D7?
07:41  jacine| yeah, could do that... still gotta upgrade though.
07:41  stephthegeek| but at least it would be as part of a bigger upgrade for themes in general
07:41  jacine| true.
07:41          <-- christefano has quit irc
07:41  stephthegeek| not just like "omg my skins stopped working"
07:41  jacine| LOL
07:43  stephthegeek| any specific thoughts on the image previews in terms of implementation?   hmm we could do autodiscover, like skin_system_name-1.png
07:44  jacine| I dunno... I think you would be better at that with all the subtheme issues you will have.
07:44  stephthegeek| heh yeah.  that's why it almost seems better not to do a path at all..
07:45  stephthegeek| hmm.. but that would mean a standard /skins subdir or something..
07:45  jacine| yeah, I don't know... but everytime I think something is going to be a problem, Bala tends to tell me it's no big deal.
07:45  stephthegeek| i'm generally not a fan of magic autodiscover things, but also not really a fan of adding a whole other line for every style
07:46  jacine| yeah, it would be nice not to have to deal with it at all in Skinr :P
07:46  jacine| or to just have 1 page that pulls a list of all of them
07:46  jacine| :P
07:46  jacine| like I said, you are better tasked with this one :) hehe
07:48  stephthegeek| right, ok i forgot there was that issue too.
07:48          * stephthegeek rereads
07:48  jacine| :D
07:51  stephthegeek| yeah i think what seems best is to specify it, as a relative dir to the info file from the theme that the skin is coming from
07:51  stephthegeek| so if you had sites/all/themes/fusion and sites/mysite.com/themes/foo   with a /skins subdir in each of those, each of those theme's info files would specify skins/screenshot-1.png
07:52          --> christefano has joined
07:52  stephthegeek| and skinr would get the path to theme for where the skins were coming from
07:52  stephthegeek| that keeps them encapsulated
07:52  jacine| sorry, got up for a sec.
07:53  jacine| yep, that was what I was thinking.
07:53  jacine| plus it's like the whole screenshot.png thing anyway, so it's familiar.
07:54  stephthegeek| right.. hmm yeah the other use case to consider is when you want the subtheme's screenshot image to override the base theme's
07:54  stephthegeek| like we have things like the inline menu style in fusion core...
07:54  stephthegeek| but that obviously looks quite different in subthemes
07:54  jacine| if you didn't specify it, it would be tough.
07:54  stephthegeek| so you might wanna do a screenshot of it in the subtheme's style
07:55  jacine| yup... fun stuff as usual. :P
07:55  stephthegeek| the subtheme could automatically take precedence if they are the same filename
07:55  stephthegeek| which goes back to the potential idea of auto discovery based on style name
07:55  jacine| stephthegeek: but that means the check needs to be done anyway.
07:55  stephthegeek| but perhaps allowing the themer to set the subdir for the screenshots
07:55  jacine| for the file.
07:55  stephthegeek| i'm more worried about wanting to give themers the choice of dirs than the choice of filenames
07:55  jacine| seems confusing.
07:56  stephthegeek| some people might want /skins or /images or /skins/screenshots...
07:56  jacine| well, yea don't forget there is no sites/all/skins
07:56  stephthegeek| does the check anyway even if there's no file?
07:56  stephthegeek| oh i know, this is relative to the theme
07:56  jacine| i mean, there is NOW: sites/all/skins
07:56  stephthegeek| oh.. oh yeah..
07:57  stephthegeek| does that support the other sites/*/skins?
07:57          * stephthegeek tries to get head around all the permutations
07:57  jacine| they work just like regular skins.
07:57  jacine| but they get shared across sites.
07:58  stephthegeek| right.. just curious if you could do sites/mysite.com/skins for skins across multiple themes but one site
07:58  jacine| ??
07:58  Druplicon| Using more than one question mark makes you sound obnoxious if you're asking for support. Please restate your question without an excess of question marks at the end. ? is also the ternary operator, see http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php
07:58  jacine| LOL
07:58  stephthegeek| oh, chris's comment there seems to say yes
07:58  stephthegeek| he mentions /sites/{default,all,sitename}/skins/*
07:58  stephthegeek| ok
07:58          * stephthegeek thinks
07:58  jacine| oh, yea.. it's just like how things normally work
07:59  jacine| yeah, that's how we have it working on the demo site now
07:59  jacine| sites/skinr/skins/superfish

09:06  jacine| sure
09:06  stephthegeek| you're a night owl  :)
09:06  jacine| yeah :)
09:07          --> Narhir has joined
09:07  jacine| crap gotta get admin role up there... hang on
09:07  stephthegeek| been discussing/writing specs for the previews... one thing that's a little funky is what to do for select elements.  my inclination is to have you be able to use a system_name.png filename without the id (system_name-1.png) and have it be a preview for the whole set rather htan each option
09:08  stephthegeek| thoughts?
09:08  stephthegeek| heh aw thanks..
09:08  jacine| yeah, each option might be crazy.
09:09  stephthegeek| i think you'd want that in most cases..
09:09  jacine| I want it for body classes to load JS files
09:09  stephthegeek| but not for things like a select list of just colour skins, or different corners to be rounded or something
09:09  jacine| LOL
09:09          * jacine doesn't want to mention that to bala right now
09:10  stephthegeek| load JS files for the whole skin set rather than just the option?
09:10  jacine| no for each option :)
09:10  stephthegeek| ahh
09:10  jacine| load a different cufon js file, for instance
09:10  stephthegeek| oh right.. heh.. ohhhh yeah, chris ran into that
09:10  stephthegeek| we had to move the equal heights style into its own section
09:10  jacine| you should make an issue then
09:10  stephthegeek| it was under some misc stuff before but then we couldn't conditionally load the js
09:11  stephthegeek| haha so it's not YOU asking?  ;)
09:11  jacine| because it would probably work to improve the situation with the previews.
09:11  jacine| yes, exactly :)
09:11  stephthegeek| i'm leaning towards automagical instead of specifying filenames at all
09:11  stephthegeek| you'd set a base path for screenshots in the .info file
09:11  jacine| yeah but then what happens as you change things.
09:11  stephthegeek| can you be a little more specific?  :)
09:12  jacine| like if you change the order of options or something
09:12  jacine| i guess it's your problem. LOL
09:12  stephthegeek| haha.. yeah.  rename your files  :P
09:14  stephthegeek| really i think that's less common than the annoyance of having to specify a whole bunch of screenshot filenames for each style
09:15  jacine| ugh, just checked a million boxes
09:16  jacine| our downloading scripts are borked apparently... and so is skinr locally for me.
09:16          * jacine hopes that change doesn't hit the server any time soon :P
09:16  jacine| stephthegeek: so for that stuff if you guys can figure it out, more power to ya.
09:16  jacine| LOL
09:17  stephthegeek| hehe.. yeah.. just involved an hour of discussion and a whiteboard
09:17  jacine| LOL
09:17          --> ShiNboi has joined
09:17  jacine| you should have access to all stuff on there now though :)
09:18          --> RockSoup has joined
09:18  stephthegeek| we'll see what we can do.  chris doesn't have time to do it personally right now but we work with a couple other folks for our dev stuff i'm going to try and have do this
09:18  jacine| cool :)
09:18  stephthegeek| hmm... i don't seem to... i don't even have skin access anymore
09:19  jacine| or not :P
09:19  stephthegeek| if it's a big pain don't worry about it, i can set something up later, just was easier to check this out quickly here if it works
09:19  jacine| I guess it would help if I gave you the role.
09:19  jacine| try again
09:19          * stephthegeek snorts
09:19  jacine| LOL
09:19  stephthegeek| yes!
09:19  stephthegeek| thanks  :)
09:19  jacine| np :)
09:20  stephthegeek| neat that you guys are using the region for primary links
09:20  stephthegeek| looking forward to possibly going that way in D7...
09:20  jacine| yeah...
09:20  stephthegeek| certainly gives the flexibility with skinr
09:20  jacine| I doubt it, but it would be nice.
09:20  stephthegeek| i mean just doing that in themes
09:20  stephthegeek| not in core
09:21  stephthegeek| i know that's probably not changing in core at this point
09:21          <-- raman has quit irc
09:21  jacine| we can at least disable the primary/secondary links :)
09:21  stephthegeek| although i guess if your theme doesn't defin.... yeah
09:21  jacine| when they fix theme settings
09:21  stephthegeek| they're broken?
09:21  jacine| they are totally borked right now
09:21  jacine| i will give you the issue...
09:24  jacine| http://drupal.org/node/629902
09:24  Druplicon| http://drupal.org/node/629902 => theme_get_setting() should return NULL for features that are disabled in a theme => Drupal, theme system, normal, needs work, 3 comments, 1 IRC mention
09:25  stephthegeek| jacine, the skinr admin section, that isn't here on your demo site?
09:25  stephthegeek| was just wondering if the skin screenshot previews should show in there too
09:25  jacine| no... something went wrong with his commit
09:26  jacine| when it goes up there it will break the demo site
09:26  stephthegeek| ah ok
09:26  stephthegeek| hehe
09:26  jacine| it's just a quick listing
09:26  stephthegeek| it lists the style names and what they're applied to or something?
09:26  jacine| but some of the admin stuff is there
09:26  jacine| http://dl.dropbox.com/u/912092/lists-2.png
09:26  stephthegeek| awesome, thanks
09:27  jacine| editing will bring up the dialog
09:27  jacine| and we are trying to get some help with panels
09:27  stephthegeek| ok, i think something additional there, if anything, could happen in a followup then
09:27  jacine| http://drupal.org/node/727396
09:27  Druplicon| http://drupal.org/node/727396 => Skinr needs drupal_alter for links array => Panels, Code, normal, active, 0 comments, 1 IRC mention
09:27  stephthegeek| i saw bala and merlin talking th eother day..
09:27  jacine| yeah, not about that though.
09:27  stephthegeek| but.. making friends?  ;)
09:28  jacine| yeah :)
09:28  stephthegeek| the stylizer stuff is interesting
09:28  jacine| yeah definitely.
09:28  jacine| we don't want to use panel styles
09:28  stephthegeek| ohh interesting.  so not using the style at all but having it as a custom alter for that set of links in the dropdown?
09:29  jacine| if you notice there is no "cog" on panes that don't have skinr styles applied, and there is not cog for panels themselves either.
09:29  jacine| yeah
09:29          * stephthegeek nods
09:29  jacine| so you can still use panel styles if you want
09:29  jacine| it's just the only way we can hook in.
09:29  stephthegeek| right
09:29  jacine| definitely sucky though.
09:29  stephthegeek| heh reminds me of views style plugins...
09:29  stephthegeek| starting to run into cases where i want to use more than one
09:30  stephthegeek| semantic views should go in views 3 at least so that doesn't take up the style
09:30  jacine| yeah... there's only so much we can do

19:33  grayloon| hey guys.  i'm curious what the second empty bracket for stylesheets is in the .info file - stylesheets[all][]
19:33  grayloon| anyone know?
19:34  grayloon| i'm asking because I want a stylesheet to appear only for my frontpage.  so i guess i was wondering if that second bracket may be some sort of condition.  can't really find an answer on the web so far.
19:38          --> nadavoid has joined
19:45  johnvsc| you know, i have wondered the same my self: is this in the bible?
19:45  johnvsc| PDD?
19:45  Druplicon| PDD is Pro Drupal Development - THE book for developers. http://www.drupalbook.com/ Pre-order the Drupal 7 edition now! http://tinyurl.com/prodrupal7
19:45  johnvsc| that is the bible, btw :)

19:47  gooddesignusa| doesn't the [] just add it to the array ?
19:50          <-- ernie has quit irc
19:51  JohnAlbin| grayloon: yes, what gooddesignusa says.
19:51  grayloon| ah.  thanks guys!
19:52  gooddesignusa| grayloon: why do you need to load another style sheet for the front page
19:52  gooddesignusa| why not just put it in ur normal css
19:53  grayloon| gooddesignusa: yeah, i will.  i just had some styles that weren't necessary to be loaded when the front page loads so i was just seeing if there was a built-in conditional way to add it.
19:53  gooddesignusa| idk i mean why bother the user is going to have to d/l the other style sheet later on when going to another page
19:53  gooddesignusa| might as well load it from the start so they can cache it
19:55  gooddesignusa| well if you really want to you could do a function mytheme_preprocess_node(&$variables) {
19:56  JohnAlbin| grayloon: if you turn on CSS optimization, then conditionally loading stylesheets will actually mean the user will have to download more KBs of css files, because when you conditionally add the CSS file, it has to re-aggregate all the CSS files and the user has to download the new larger aggregated file.

19:56  JohnAlbin| grayloon: so its actually worse for performance and your bandwidth.
19:57  mikey_p-office| although so many modules add their css on only 1 page, and that ends up requiring a new download
19:57  mikey_p-office| i wish the default for drupal_add_css and drupal_add_js was aggregation off by default

20:06  mikey_p-office| JohnAlbin: there's a patch in the queue for 7 to make sure that js defined as libraries is not aggregated
20:06  JohnAlbin| I don't think many people realize how often CSS aggregation gets rebuilt as people traverse a site.
20:06  mikey_p-office| i think pwolanin and kkaefer are working on it
20:06          <-- MattV has quit irc
20:06  mikey_p-office| should that patch get ported to css as well?
20:07  grayloon| JohnAlbin: wow.  ok that's a great little tidbit of info.  glad i know that now.  thank you
