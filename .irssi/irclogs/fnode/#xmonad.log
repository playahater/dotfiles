04:54  dmwit| It seems like the obvious optimization here is to assume that there is at least one pixel per character.
04:54  dmwit| So we can truncate the title to at most the tab width (in pixels) to start with.
04:56  ivanm| I would have thought that it would have already done that...
04:57  ivanm| silly me ;-)
04:57  ivanm| so the bound becomes O((min(n,l))^2)

13:25  amina| Hi, I am trying to install xmonad on Ubuntu and I ran the command that replaces metacity with xmonad. Now I get an empty screen and none of the shortcuts given on the website work. I tried reverting to metacity from the recovery console but it did not work.

14:13  adri_| Replacing metacity with xmonad gives me an empty gnome desktop with a busy cursor -- Trying to run it gives me the following: xmonad-x86_64-linux: executeFile: does not exist (No such file or directory).
14:14  adri_| However using xsession works beautifully (except I don't have things such as gnome network manager so I'd rather run xmonad under gnome).
14:14  MrElendig| adri_: make yourself a config and xmonad --recompile
14:16          --> dual has joined
14:17  adri_| MrElendig, I now get this: http://pastie.org/849701

14:39  progo| Hmm, I closed a floating window via mod-shift-c and it closed three windows :O
14:49  adri_|  Sorry but I actually can't figure out why the keybindings don't work.
14:49  adri_| Right now I have a gnome menu and system tray, the windows in between are being tiled by xmonad. However mod-* (= alt-*) has no effect.
14:50  adri_| I tried adding modMask = mod4Mask to xmonad.hs followed by xmonad --recompile but it did nothing.
14:51  MrElendig| pastebin the config?
14:51  the_german| adri_ : what session did you log in: .xsession or gnome???
14:51  MrElendig| also, did you actually restart xmonad after changing the config?
14:52  the_german| mod + q should recompile and it should all work

14:55  MrElendig| hpaste and a few others have syntax highlithing for haskell btw
14:55  MrElendig| anyway, looks ok
14:56  MrElendig| mod-q or xmonad --recompile && xmonad --restart  and it should work

15:25  dsdeiz| hi, how do i resolve when i click on Full View say in youtube, it just closes.. is this an xmonad thing? :-/
15:26  dschoepe| dsdeiz: put isFullscreen --> doFullFloat in your manage hook
15:26  dschoepe| (and import XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers)
15:28  dsdeiz| dschoepe: ahh works like a charm..
15:30  dsdeiz| one more thing :D if i try to move a floating window in a Full layout, it somehow then switches the window being viewed to the 'master pane'/first window.. makes sense? hehehe

15:32  og01| works great
15:35  dsdeiz| dschoepe: i guess we'll wait for the udpate right?
15:35  og01| im not sure about this bug you speak of, but is the patch in darcs already?
15:35  dschoepe| no
15:35  og01| k thanks
15:36  dschoepe| the fix to the problem would probably require some bigger changes to the floating layer, so it might take a while

15:44  pielgrzym| hi :) I use 3 column layout as my IM workspace only layout. Is it possible to embed a tabbed layout into the center, biggest column? With layout combinators?
15:45          <-- sainthuck has quit irc
15:45          -#- saintluck is known as sainthuck
15:47  hgabreu| pielgrzym: sure it's possible, the way to achieve depends on what you want exactly
15:47  hgabreu| most flexible ones, that I use, are SubLayouts and ComboP
15:48  pielgrzym| hgabreu: I'd like to have two windows in the center, the one above should be a nested tabbed layout :) let me take a peek at both those things you mentioned :) thanks for info :)
15:49  og01| pielgrzym: i set this up today, now every layout i use has the ability to tab in any window i like
15:49  og01| pielgrzym: i just used the example in http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Layout-SubLayouts.html
15:49  hgabreu| sublayouts then
15:49  og01| it was alot easier to setup then i thought it would be
15:49  pielgrzym| og01: thanks!!
15:49  pielgrzym| og01: hopefully :)
15:50  og01| if you need a hand - give me a shout - cause as i said - just got this working today
15:50  hgabreu| og01: I had the same felling.. guess I was a bit afraid of sublayouts
15:51  og01| just put windowNavigation $ subTabbed $ boringWindows $ at the front of your layouts, the settup the keybindings and thats it
15:52  og01| *then setup the keybindings
15:52  og01| the pullGroup L/R/U/D bindings basicly merge (tab) with the window to the up/down/left or right

20:49  aavogt| pielgrzym: yeah, sublayouts is a hack

20:49  hgabreu| pielgrzym: you're welcome
20:49  aavogt| but I'm not sure if you can directly blame it, because it doesn't draw the tabs
20:50  pielgrzym| aavogt: yeah, but it tried to put pure tabbed layout inside tabs again - I think this was actually the problem :)
20:51  pielgrzym| aavogt: if you take a peek at line 90 of my config you can see a tabbed' layout :) it was double-hacked :)
20:52  pielgrzym| could someone explain me what does this first subLayout argument (a list of Ints) do? the documentation just devastated my mind ;) I just don't get this advanceInnerLayouts stuff :)

20:57  aavogt| hmm, that is confusing when I read it after the fact
20:57  pielgrzym| is there a way to tell xmonad to automatically group windows in a sublayout beggining with window x if the total window number is larger than y?

07:13  tensorpudding| XMonad compiles xmonad.hs with --make right?
07:14  tensorpudding| i.e. will it handle module dependencies that are local to the directory and not installed system-wide and registered to ghc?
