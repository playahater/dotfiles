04:18  narafir| anyone? views search cannot search for username!
04:18  cafuego| Creativitylives: I've done that by adding a specific CCK content type to rate each different node type. The CCK type can have as many fivestar fields (axes) as you like.
04:19  Creativitylives| did u use the voting axes: field in fivestar?
04:20  Creativitylives| I added a number of axis verified the target id using node ref but views isnt calculating the average
04:20  Creativitylives| maybe im not setting something up right cafuego
04:21          --> tr has joined
04:21  cafuego| The average here is a scary amalgamation of weightings done via a custom php field in views -  you don't wanna know.
04:22  Creativitylives| thats what i was trying to do

04:23  Creativitylives| cafuego it cant be done with a relationship or nething?
04:23  devkinetic|  hey all i want to add a field to my content type to represent an age range for a class. any ideas? like a class runs from ages 6-10 and i want to supply a dropdown of ages to expose in my view to filter
04:24  cafuego| Creativitylives: I expect it can ... but that's not how it works on my site.
04:24  cafuego| devkinetic: You should probably use a taxonomy for that
04:25  devkinetic| cafuego, can you elaborate a bit
04:25  devkinetic| cafuego, this would be my first time
04:25  devkinetic| (not with drupal but doing this)
04:25  Creativitylives| so theres no easy way to do it cafuego?
04:26  cafuego| devkinetic: You can create a vocabulary called 'Age range' and then add terms to that vocabulary.
04:26  devkinetic| cafuego, i'll try that out right now
04:27  cafuego| devkinetic: The terms would be strings, like "0-6" or "7-12"
04:27  cafuego| devkinetic: ... and make sure your assign that vocabulary to your content type, so you can choose it :-)

04:29  asfahaan| HI all http://www.dev.acceleratingaotearoa.co.nz/?q=blog
04:29  asfahaan| how do i rename Blogs to News?? which file do I need to edit ?
04:31          <-- Nikit has quit irc
04:31  dekita| hack core?
04:31  Druplicon| You should never hack core. There is always a better way. There are exceptions but those are extremely rare. (If you really can't do what you need to without changing core, please contribute your fix upstream as a patch, but ask around first; it really is quite rare.) Also, think of the kittens: http://tinyurl.com/hack-core and http://kuvaton.com/kuvei/whack-a-kitty.gif

04:33          <-- tim666 has left
04:33  easement_1| How do i check in a template.php  preproccess_page if a certain taxonomy term is set?
04:33  easement_1| I'm using D6
04:35  easement_1| if a taxonomy term is set for a node.  for instance the taxonomy is either normal width / wide width and will get set in $vars and then be used as a body class.
04:36  easement_1| Is there a better way to do it? I'm planning on using taxonomy, but I could do it as a CCK field.
04:36  easement_1| either way, is there a way to get preprocess_page() to know about it?
04:37          <-- dunkoh has quit irc
04:37  asfahaan| How to change Blogs title to News ??
04:38  cafuego| easement_1: There is a CCK Taxonomy module that adds flexibility :-)
04:39  pinglaura| asfahaan: If you're already down the road of using the blog module, then that's pretty hard coded. You could use string replacement module or locale module to translate that. Or you could just create a content type called "news".
04:39  cafuego| easement_1: if $vars['node']->taxonomy[term id'] exists, that term is set.

04:46  dekita| asfahaan: I'd go with pinglaura's suggestion and create a new content type called news.
04:46  dekita| the blog module is for blogs
04:47  asfahaan| oh okay
04:47  asfahaan| and then use views or something to display it ?
04:47  dekita| yeah
04:47  cafuego| Well, the Story type already works like News, tbh.
04:47  dekita| you could do that with the blog listing also and change the title
04:47  dekita| but 'blog' will slip through in places
04:48  easement_1| cafuego: thanks I'll look into that.

04:57  cafuego| ryanarmstrong: Except rather than putting that in the tpl file, I would create $vars['mymenu'] in phptemplate_preprocess_page() in template.php and set its value to print theme('links', menu_navigation_links('menu-custom-menu',0));
04:57  cafuego| ryanarmstrong: and then simply print $mymenu in the tpl file.
04:57          <-- minus_ has quit irc
04:57  ryanarmstrong| Ok that makes sense. Thanks! I'll try that out
04:58  cafuego| good luck ;-)
04:58  ryanarmstrong| lol
04:58  ryanarmstrong| thanks :O
05:02  dekita| ryanarmstrong: another option is just assigning the menu block to a region on your page...
05:02  ryanarmstrong| Yea that was my first attempt
05:03  ryanarmstrong| unfortunately I can't get regions and blocks working right on my theme
05:03  ryanarmstrong| I based it off Zen, but then basically ripped out everything in page.tpl
05:03  ryanarmstrong| :(
05:03  ryanarmstrong| lol
05:03  ryanarmstrong| Like I said, I'm really new to theming, so its all been a learning process

05:04  dekita| more info ^
05:04  ryanarmstrong| Out of curiosity, I know to make a region you first add it to your .info file, but then how do you set it up in your page.tpl file?
05:05  ryanarmstrong| I tried using something like: <?php if ($right): ?>
05:05  ryanarmstrong|         <div id="sidebar-right"><div id="sidebar-right-inner" class="region region-right">
05:05  ryanarmstrong|           <?php print $right; ?>
05:05  ryanarmstrong|         </div></div> <!-- /#sidebar-right-inner, /#sidebar-right -->
05:05  ryanarmstrong|       <?php endif; ?>

05:05  cafuego| that'll only work if preprocess_page() shoves data into $vars['right'] eh
05:06  dekita| that's it, but might need to clear your theme registry cache for the new region to show up
05:06  nomad411| Hi..  is anyone here in the Drupalgardens beta?
05:06  nomad411| It doesn't seem to work for me. I let it create me a site from scratch, but now nothing

07:32  BANSAL| hi everyone !
07:32  devkinetic| HAI!

07:32  BANSAL| http://tinypic.com/r/fnwnl3/6
07:32  BANSAL| this is here...
07:32  hunvreus| but no cookies
07:33  BANSAL| if anyone can tell me what's that... and how can i fix it...
07:33  raman| <hunvreus>:ok
07:34  hunvreus| cookies swould be nice though
07:34  hunvreus| maybe we should vouch for that
07:35  BANSAL| anyone  ??
07:35          <-- Nikit has quit irc
07:37  raman| hunvreus:for one module we will have only one MENU_CALLBACK is it correct
07:37  hunvreus| you can have as many as you want
07:37  hunvreus| BANSAL: hmmm, no idea
07:38  hunvreus| what did you do before this happened
07:38  hunvreus| give us context
07:38  BANSAL|  hunvreus: did u see module.inc file line 483 ?
07:39  hunvreus| BANSAL: give me some context
07:39  BANSAL| i put & to the second parameter and problem resolved... i mean warnings didn't appear...
07:39  hunvreus| if u think it's a pretty common error, just google it
07:39          --> sadist has joined
07:39  BANSAL| but then Deprecated: Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated in /opt/lampp/htdocs/nik/includes/module.inc on line 483 appeared
07:39          <-- chrowe has quit irc
07:40          <-- lotyrin has quit irc
07:40  raman| hunvreus:it means i should change my path context to have one more MENU_CALLBACK right in same module
07:40  hunvreus| no
07:40  hunvreus| you just need one callback and two arguments in the URL
07:40  hunvreus| as I explained you earlier
07:41  BANSAL| hunvreus: well these warnings appearing every time when m installing user relationship mudule and like this module...
07:41  raman| hunvreus:okk 
07:41  hunvreus| BANSAL: did you google the error ?
07:41  BANSAL| yeah i googled it ...
07:41  hunvreus| BANSAL: did you search for that issue in the issue queue of the User Relationship module ?
07:41          <-- christefano has quit irc
07:41  BANSAL| i got that & idea from there only...
07:42  BANSAL| but that was for different error....
07:42  devkinetic| BANSAL, pass by referance is when you do &$var
07:42  BANSAL| but it was also showing "parameter 2 to ....."
07:42  sadist| i'm looking for any guide or tutorial to integrate facebook_style with heartbeat.module. anyone to teach me here?
07:42  BANSAL| hunvreus: yeah u r right !!
07:43  hunvreus| ?
07:43  BANSAL| hunvreus: sry 
07:43  BANSAL| devkinetic: u r right !!
07:43  sadist| all over the net is just questions about that, but no guide/tutorial
07:43  hunvreus| sadist: nope
07:43          --> zdravko has joined
07:43  devkinetic| sadist, write a module :D
07:43  devkinetic| hack that out
07:44  BANSAL| devkinetic: any idea what do i do ?
07:44  sadist| the problem is, i myself got confused over how to integrate that together :D
07:45  devkinetic| BANSAL, its depreciated by php, i think you can turn off the warning, but google would be better for that. Also see what other in the issue queue are saying
07:46  zdravko| folks, I have create a YouTube node type with node references to one or more Name, Location and Subject type, node types ... now, how on earth do I list all videos that are attached to any one of the Names, Locations or Subject types ?
07:46  devkinetic| zdravko, views?
07:46  devkinetic| views?
07:46  Druplicon| The Views module lets Drupal site designers present content in flexible lists and tables. http://drupal.org/project/views
07:46  zdravko| devkinetic: sorry, yes in Views?
07:48  zdravko| I filter on node type Location and then it seems to let me set up a Relationship to content_location, from where I was hoping to join back to YouTube node type, but no go !
07:49  devkinetic| zdravko, you can just limit it to those youtube node types?
07:50  zdravko| devkinetic: are you saying that i should filter on youtube node type which has a specific node reference for a location of interest ?
07:51  devkinetic| zdravko, maybe? :D views is confusing. I usually end up trying things for like an hour until i gte it right
07:52          --> christefano has joined
07:53  raman| hunvreus:suppose based on menu type such as MENU_NORMAL_ITEM and MENU_CALLBACK i can two functions but  it is not working i have path like this=>admin/user/userroles in menu_normal_item and admin/user/userroles/photos in menu_calback is it correct

Sometimes records need to be included if they match one or more filters in a list of alternatives. Views has the ability to combine filters only with AND. If one filter is false, the combined list will be false. Views Or adds the ability to combine blocks of filters with OR. If one of the filters in the block is true, the combi

12:08  dekita| and http://api.drupal.org/api/function/hook_form_FORM_ID_alter/6

12:24  ram_| dekita:it's working
12:25  ram_| dekita:it' s not working in registration form
12:26  ram_| dekita:sorry in login form
12:26  ram_| dekita:it's working in register form why so
12:26  dekita| ram_: the form id is visible as hidden element in the form source
12:27  dekita| you'll need to use a regular hook_form_alter to catch two form ids
12:27          --> RockSoup has joined
12:27  dekita| but like I said, a text translate approach would be easier/better than form alter
12:27  dekita| that's what the t() function is for..
12:27  dekita| to allow translation
12:28  dekita| asfahaan: create the block in views and add a new block display with those defaults
12:28  dekita| or use a module like 
12:28  dekita| multiblock?
12:28  Druplicon| multiblock is allows the creation of multiple block instances of already existing blocks. http://drupal.org/project/multiblock
12:28  asfahaan| Coool

14:51  mun| WormFood, thanks
14:52  nucking| personal opinion question, which one is your favorite wysiwyg module/editor?
14:52  WormFood| nucking, vim
14:52  keyo| ekes: awesome. This site has everything done the old bad way. Event module instead of calendar + views and so on
14:52  nucking| i mean for drupal of course
14:52  nucking| =P
14:52  WormFood| nucking, I render html in my head, so I use vim for WYSIWYG :P
14:52          --> KamusHadenes has joined
14:52  ekes| keyo: it was the old way :) I had plenty of those from years back.
14:53  WormFood| maybe not WYSIWYG for most users tho ;)
14:53  WormFood| nucking, I installed ALL of the WYSIWYG editors, except one (which didn't work)
14:53          --> bertboerland has joined
14:54  nucking| WormFood, which one would you recommend the most usability wise?
14:54  WormFood| nucking, it seems most people like fckeditor/ckeditor or tinymce....I think I'm leaning more towards fckeditor, but still up in the air for me
14:54  nucking| i see
14:54  WormFood| I think they're all usable
14:54  WormFood| they have different options
14:54  WormFood| and output code differently
14:54  WormFood| I think I like the code that fckeditor outputs better
14:54  nucking| same here, generally i go for fckeditor, but i'm not particularly fond of the wysiwyg + imce combo
14:54          --> ernie has joined

14:55          --> AstroMix has joined
14:56  WormFood| if you have existing text, with CR/LF in it, it appears that ALL of the WYSIWYG editors will destroy that, which means you can't add it to a site, without having an hassle if you edit old content.
14:56  nucking| WormFood, i'm not speaking for myself, i prefer pure html as well

14:56          --> stella has joined
14:56  WormFood| yeah, I feel my (stupid) users want WYSIWYG editors
14:56  nimzie| a agree with WormFood - FCK Seems to be the best of them all.. There's also the wysiwyg module which can do all or any in verying combos for different roles...
14:56          --> rightsprocket has joined
14:56  WormFood| I personally would rather use straight html too
14:57  nucking| i'm speaking for the people i have to explain the wysiwyg editors, and the image uploading/handling is always the point where people cringe a little
14:57          --> crdant has joined
14:57  WormFood| nimzie, the WYSIWYG module is just an interface for various editors
14:57  WormFood| yeah, I'm not real happy with any of the image uploaded systems being offered
14:57  nucking| heh, yeah that's the other thing, there's the fckeditor module and the wysiwyg module
14:57          <-- KamusHadenes has quit irc
14:58  nucking| i like the idea behind the wysiwyg module more, but the fckeditor module seems to be more active =P
14:58  WormFood| nucking, fckeditor is just added as files...the WYSIWYG module will detect it, and enable it for you automagically
14:58  nucking| neverending story
14:58  nucking| WormFood, i was referring to the fckeditor module, not the editor
14:59  nucking| http://drupal.org/project/fckeditor
14:59  WormFood| if ckeditor would handle file uploading better, I'd be in love with it
14:59  nimzie| i imagine it won't be too long before there'a sgood intergration with something for file editing

15:05  AstroMix| thanks nucking
15:05  nucking| you're welcome
15:06  AstroMix| how exactly would I use this? I was planning on generating a random string and then putting that into the "value" of the password field.
15:07          <-- svendecabooter has quit irc
15:07  nucking| AstroMix, is form api a module?

15:08  iKb| default_value => user_password();
15:08  nucking| AstroMix, you can assign the user_password() function as the default value

15:10  AstroMix| like so?

15:10  AstroMix| 		'#title' => t('Password'),

15:10  AstroMix| 		'#default value' => user_password(),

15:11  nucking| i think you need an underscore between default value

15:11  cal3b| I think I must be being a total idiot in finding the field variables to print in my view. It really can't be that hard : |
15:13  nucking| cal3b, the themeing info has lots of info about that
15:13  iKb| if you want just to suggest the password you can't use an hidden field
15:14  AstroMix| well the next part of the plan is to have the auto-generated password send an email out just like the normal user registration does.
15:14  AstroMix| i have users creating other users of lower hierarchical roles
15:14  cal3b| nucking, I've read it, in theory I know what to do, in practice it's not working. When I dsm the fields the array it returns doesn't hold any field names. When I print what looks like the field names (going by everything I've read) nothing is returned. I just must be missing something.

15:15  cal3b| yes, if I wrap $output in a div, that works fine.
15:15          --> rampy has joined
15:15  nucking| nono, i mean on the view level
15:15  nucking| what is the name of your tpl file?
15:15  cal3b| views-view-field--featuredcontent.tpl.php
15:16  nucking| oh ok, you wanna get further in?
15:16          <-- rampy has quit irc
15:16          <-- Cvelde has quit irc
15:16  nucking| to edit the actual field?
15:16  cal3b| that contains two fields, one for the image, one for the text. $output seems to output this into the loop.
15:16  cal3b| I need to get further in
15:16  cal3b| so I can wrap both fields in tags.
15:17  nucking| cal3b, get devel, activate devel themer and click on it
15:17  cal3b| have done that.
15:17  nucking| it should suggest you what function you need to copy to your template.php and edit
15:18  nucking| and how to name it
15:18          --> skilip has joined
15:18  iKb| cal3b
15:18  iKb| check the [0]
15:18  cal3b| I need to add something to my template.php? OK.
15:19  cal3b| iKb, I will do that.
15:19  cal3b| thanks for the help both of you.
15:19  nucking| cal3b, when you have theme developer enabled and click your link what function do you get suggested?
15:20  nucking| i mean, when you click your field
15:20  cal3b| Function called?
15:20  nucking| yes
15:20  cal3b| theme_imagefield_image()
15:21  nucking| ok, above the function name is the file that has that function
15:21  iKb| this is to theme all the imagefield
15:21  nucking| navigate to the file and make a copy of the function
15:21  nucking| and paste it into your template.php
15:22  iKb| this will theme all the fields not the specific one
15:22  nucking| well yes, after copying it you need to decide on the specificy
15:23  cal3b| it doesn't matter that it's views creating the output?
15:23  nucking| cal3b, the view creates it by calling the function
15:23          --> Art_ has joined
15:24  cal3b| so, the parents of that function, the top lv is theme_imagefield_formatter_image_plain
15:24  cal3b| it seems I don't know half as much about this as I was hoping I did...
15:24  iKb| cal3b
15:25  iKb| check in the theme info the tpl file name
15:25  iKb| create it and print what you whant
15:26          --> Cvelde has joined

15:28  cal3b| I created a cck node with two fields, one for an image, one for text, I've printed that in a view, and I just need to wrap it in tags to create a featured content slider, it's been a total nightmare.
15:29  nucking| cal3b, it takes a little to fully understand it, you're not far away
15:29          <-- ram_ has quit irc
15:29  skh_| nucking: why not rewrite output, wrap it in the tags?
15:30  skh_| err, sorry i mean cal3b
15:30  cal3b| nucking, each time I think I'm there I get another issue : )
15:30  cal3b| skh_, no idea how : )
15:30  nucking| cal3b, don't worry the moment you realize the principle of using the template.php to override theme functions you're pretty much done
15:30  skh_| cal3b: it's done right in views, goto the field and check the rewrite output box
15:31          --> rho has joined
15:31  nucking| cal3b, or that ^
15:31  cal3b| skh_, Ah, that field I was wondering wtf does that do : )
15:31  skh_| =)
15:31  cal3b| the views themeing info I read
15:32  cal3b| seemed to say could you find and print fields, much the same as you can print variables in a cck node.
15:32  cal3b| http://drupal.org/node/352970
15:32  Druplicon| http://drupal.org/node/352970 => Views 2 theming => 0 comments, 47 IRC mentions
15:32  cal3b| that seemed to make sence, but didn't work for some reason.
15:33  cal3b| nucking, yes, I think the template.php is about the last hill to climb (for now).
15:33  AstroMix| can i send html through drupal_mail_send()?
15:34  nucking| cal3b, did you try the rewrite output method skh_ suggested?
15:34  cal3b| I need to do some reading on how that works. I'm not sure if it will do what i need.
15:35  AstroMix| what do you need cal3b?
15:35  cal3b| I've an image and a bit of text that repeats 5x
15:35  AstroMix| ok
15:35  AstroMix| and your goal is?
15:35  nucking| cal3b, just go to your view, click on the field and check the rewrite output checkbox, you should be prompted with a textarea and possible replacement patterns
15:35  cal3b| for each time it repeats, I need both wrapped in a <li> tag
15:36  cal3b| I want to make it work with the s3 slider script
15:36  cal3b| basicly.
15:36  AstroMix| yes rewrite output will wrap them all in <li>s
15:36  iKb| http://drupal.org/project/htmlmail
15:36  AstroMix| so if you have two fields in the view
15:36  AstroMix| the first being the image and the second being the text
15:36  cal3b| so I need <li> then image printed <span>text</span></li>
15:36  skh_| cal3b: goto the field you want to wrap in views, and check the 'rewrite output' box, some new options will appear, and you can wrap it there
15:36  cal3b| repeated 5x.
15:37          --> cfuller12 has joined
15:37  AstroMix| rewrite the output of the image (in my scenario) like <li>$fieldjunk
15:37  AstroMix| then rewrite the output of the text  $fieldjunk</li>
15:37  AstroMix| because you want them both together in an <li> yes?
15:37  cal3b| correct : )
15:38  AstroMix| right so in whichever field is first, open the tag then close it in the second field's re-write
15:38  cal3b| just wondering what exactly I put in the rewrite box?
15:38  skh_| cal3b: AstroMix is correct but off on the syntax, in the rewrite output it would be <li>[replacement_pattern_of_image]</li>
15:38  cal3b| thanks for all the help everyone btw, this has been driving me mental.
15:38  iKb| enable token
15:38  AstroMix| [replacement_pattern] lol yeah

15:39  skh_| cal3b: ya, nothin to read =P
15:39  cal3b| hah
15:39  AstroMix| you have access to the fields above the one you're in and the field you're in

15:46  AstroMix| just <a></a> and the like.

20:01  egoleo| scolson, u need to create a view and filter it using a node type
20:02  egoleo| and make sure that block does appear for only specific user group
20:02  scolson| egoleo, I've done that. I'm passing the view an arg of the logged in user and tying it to a relationship to tie it to OG, but it only shows the OG post, not the child content types

21:47  stephthegeek| scolson, well you can either create the block first, or click New custom content in the left column
21:47  stephthegeek| that just makes a custom pane... like a custom block but just for this panel

22:01  scolson| stephthegeek, do you happen to know if it is easy or hard to programmatically implement a custom pane? If it isn't terribly hard, I might just convert the hook_block
22:01          --> brianpuccio has joined
22:01  stephthegeek| scolson, i'm not sure.  i'm not the one who does that kind of thing  :)  but one of our devs did a couple custom panes for this site.. i don't think it's particularly hard
22:01          <-- nmsss has quit irc
22:02  dustincurrie_| scolson: why not implement hook_block, create a page_manager panel and export using features.
22:02  dustincurrie_| Boom, everything is source controlled.

22:03          --> jeffh has joined
22:03  scolson| dustincurrie, sounds good. Now I have to look up the latter 2/3 of your suggestion
22:03  scolson| I haven't used panels since 1.x, and even then not a lot programmatically at the time
22:03  dustincurrie_| this solution wouldn't require any programming other than hook_block
22:04  dustincurrie_| panels is very strong right now
22:04  dustincurrie_| and features is now critical for any drupal site of any size
22:04          <-- allisterb_ has quit irc
22:05  scolson| there are some things (contexts) that panels was always good for, but for most of the sites my firm has worked with, it added too much overhead for the benefits it offered, but now I'm trying to finish up a site that needs contexts
22:05  stephthegeek| you mean any site with a staging process and developers  ;)
22:06  scolson| we manage sites with > 1.5m nodes all the way down to small client sites. Complete with the staging process
22:06          --> allisterb has joined
22:06  dustincurrie_| agree.  panels results in a TON of queries.  Very useful in situations where you can cache it or use it for rapid dev

22:08  scolson| I've got a load balanced set of varnish instances that feed from a webapp pool -- works fantastic
22:08          <-- jeffh has quit irc
22:08  dustincurrie_| but I'm a bit scared of trying varnish out on anything big
22:08  scolson| only drawback of varnish is lack of ssl support
22:08          <-- mindmidday has quit irc
22:08  scolson| varnish is just boost on steroids
22:09  dustincurrie_| the intriguing thing about it to me is that it avoides overhead of apache

22:17  Narhir| I guess he mean something more simpler
22:17  Narhir| RS-232 : can you try to explain it better to us ?
22:17  scolson| rs-232. drupal can feed flash lots of stuff (amfphp, etc) but I still haven't seen any templates on the market
22:18  RS-232| I just need flash menus (fancy buttons and all that stuff), and some "movement" on screen....but I still need the flexibility of drupal, CCK , Views, etc.. A customer wants Flash and Drupal

22:21  stephthegeek| RS-232, you don't necessarily need flash for that... you can do some nice subtle but dynamic menu effects and things with jquery
22:21  Narhir| just hire someone and ask him whatever you want to have ;d
22:22  Narhir| stephthegeek : I agree :P and I will strongly do not suggest using flash for menu.
22:22  Narhir| it is one of worsest ideas ever.. but sometimes.. client want it :/

23:41  BorisBarowski| sadly, no :)
23:42  BorisBarowski| skh_, hmm, that is not so good news :/
23:42  zdravko| in terms of data , there is just 'node reference" ... the node relationship module adds all sorts of UI sugar ... the node referrer module enables the referred nodes to have a list of referring nodes that are "pointing" to it ... the Views module is excellent in all of this as follows ...
23:42          --> deciphered has joined
23:43  dekita| BorisBarowski: you might be able to use hook_preprocess_views_exposed_form to alter it
23:43  BorisBarowski| When I add a relationship (for fun), i do get a relationship field on the filter-setting-pane
23:44  BorisBarowski| any idea what that is for?

23:45          <-- davexoxide has quit irc
23:45  dekita| so you can have different filters for different sides of the relationship iirc

03:54  tsssys| Hi all. Anyone ever seen this? I'm using Ubiquity theme; I've also noticed this on basic Zen theme. Except for a brief period of 15 minutes last night while trying to configure an events calendar, I've never seen sidebar blocks (like navigation, recent comments, etc) display on the "home" page, whether logged in or not. Never a problem with Garland or many other themes I have used or tried,...
03:54  tsssys| ...just the Zen based themes. I don't see anything in template.php or the css styles that would cause this. Clicking on any other link from primary or secondary menus, which is to say any other page on the site, display blocks in the sidebar where they should be. Any ideas? Am I missing something really basic here?

Now if users upload images that are wider than a specified width the site design breaks. What I'd like to do is to automatically add an imagecache preset which will scale down the image (and if possible also create a link to the larger image). Does anyone kn

06:48  YesCT| I want to use the awesome migrate modules to do some tests on this data I have ... but I have to get it into mysql first.
06:49  dougvann| YesCT:  http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/migrating-from-microsoft.html  half way down suggests some tools useful for migration
06:49  YesCT| I just finished reading that! :)
06:50  YesCT| dougvann: good to know I'm on the right track.
06:51  YesCT| I'm a bit confused, because I thought it would be like a mysql export to mysql import.. doing and export to a file, then run a convert tool, then do an import... but the article makes it sound like it's a convert direct from db to db.
06:51  YesCT| I didnt even make the current ms sql application (uses access and something called ODBC.
06:52  YesCT| But I'm supposed to get quotes on converting the whole thing to Drupal, and I wanted to get the data out of the database, so I could clean it up, making it much smaller and taking client personal info out, before sending it out to shops for quotes...
06:53  dougvann| at Duo we did this last Nov. My director of devs converted the msssql and placed the tables in my MySQL of my Drupal install. Then I wrote over a dozen lil scripts to pars those tables and create users, and nodes in Drupal
06:53  dougvann| i dunno exactly how he got from MS to My
06:53  YesCT| hmmm

06:55  YesCT| I've played with migrate, table wizard and schema doing an import from excel exported cvs file to import to drupal and I liked the tools. 
06:55  YesCT| so I feel like if I could "just get the data out" of ms sql, I could "do something" 
06:55  dougvann| YesCT:  but our CTO is in. so I can ask him if on Mon if u still need some words of wisdom
06:56  YesCT| dougvann: I'll ping you on Monday if I havent found a way by then. Thanks.

09:11  cal3b| bit strange, but anyone have any idea why javascript wouldn't work on a page created by views?
09:11  WormFood| WTF? I just installed fckedit, and edited a page, and it worked perfect....I go to edit another page, and it won't work. I've added <br> to the list of acceptable html code, and it still won't render it, it just displays it like text....anyone got a clue what is going on?
09:12  MikeChelen| cal3b: use javascript error console to see what is happening?
09:12  WormFood| this is going to drive me CRAZY!

09:16  MikeChelen| WormFood: does the <br> tag work too on that page?

09:17  MikeChelen| cal3b: should give a rough idea where to look, there are some other great FF addons including firebug that can help explore javascript deeper

09:18  WormFood| it only formatted the text properly on the first page I edited...all the other pages I edited have everything running together...no breaks, no anything
09:18  WormFood| that MAKES NO GOD DAMN SENSE!!!

09:42  MikeChelen| WormFood: use an install profile to automatically configure new site

09:42  WormFood| ooohhhh...instal profile eh? I'll have to learn up on that ;)
09:43          <-- ddram has quit irc
09:43  WormFood| so I can make an install profile, to set default settings I commonly set for all new sites, right?
09:43  WormFood| I had totally forgotten about the install profile, and only bumped into it a few times on the drupal site.
09:44          <-- phunster_ has quit irc
09:45  MikeChelen| that is my understanding of how it works, haven't actually tried using it though. might be worthwhile when adminning large number of sites
09:46          <-- zdravko has quit irc
09:47  WormFood| well, when I install a new site, it is common to go through an enable a standard group of modules, and make some setting changes (like making the admin menu always at the top of the page, for example)
09:47  WormFood| I wished there was an easy way to see what modules are in use on a site, in case extra modules were enabled that are not being used.
09:48  WormFood| note, I said "in use", and I'm not talking about "enabled modules"
09:48  MikeChelen| would be nice, sounds tricky
09:48  BassPlaya| guys, I'm out.. off to .. Xiamen ;-)
09:48  WormFood| 厦门?
09:48  MikeChelen| install profiles should do most of that
09:49  WormFood| I don't remember if i've been to 厦门 or not...but I know the name
09:49  MikeChelen| might also check out drush, which can install, enable, or disable modules through the command line (which can be scripted)
09:49  BassPlaya| WormFood: don't know that mate :-)
09:49  WormFood| MikeChelen, I do use drush...really sweet tool
09:49  WormFood| I'm gonna script the hell out of it

09:50  WormFood| I'll use it to automagically run cron, without having to install cron for each and every site. :D
09:50  WormFood| now if I could just figure out how to make drush put a site into maintenance mode, I'll be all set (I know it can do it, but I don't know how...yet)

10:06  dekita| WormFood: and if you want to set them programmaticaly, you can variable_set theme or add $conf to settings.php - allowed_html_1 = '<a> <b> ....';
10:06  dekita| s/theme/them
10:06  dekita| hi iKb
10:07  WormFood| dekita, I'm aware of setting them in the input filter configuration, but I want to enable a few more tags as default for all sites (on my shared drupal install)
10:08  dekita| WormFood: perhaps an $conf statement in settings.php then?
10:08  WormFood| dekita, but if I add the allowed html to the settings.php file, I won't be able to change them in the web based interface, will I?
10:08  dekita| correct
10:08  WormFood| I don't want to force it, I just want to add more tags to the default enabled tags

10:52  wojciechF| hi
10:52  Druplicon| hi
10:53  wojciechF| what approach would you recommend if I want to build a hierarchical gallery
10:53  wojciechF| GALLERY \ CERTAIN_GALLERY \ few images
10:53  wojciechF| i want to organize listing of images by galleries
10:53          -#- Guest35716 is known as ovidyou
10:54  wojciechF| i'd like to use views module as it can be used with services because I need to have Flash and non-flash version of my galleries
10:55  wojciechF| I'm a flash developer but with very little experience in Drupal
10:55  voxpelli| wojciechF: CCK Imagefield + Taxonomy?
10:55  wojciechF| I thought of CCK Imagefield and Taxonomy but wanted to ask more experienced users like you :)
10:56  voxpelli| It would work good with Views and Services
10:56  voxpelli| I think
10:56  voxpelli| Yeah it should
10:56  wojciechF| desired user workflow is that the user sees GALLERY option in menu
10:56  wojciechF| clicks that GALLERY and sees a listing of galleries
10:57  voxpelli| wojciechF: With Views arguments you can choose to display a summary if no argument is specified - that summary can be of all available taxonomy terms in a specific vocabulary for example
10:58  voxpelli| wojciechF: So just create a view - add a page display with the desired path and have it create a menu item. Add an argument for a taxonomy term and have it show a summary when it's not specified
10:58  wojciechF| than the user clicks certain gallery and sees a list of thumbnails
10:59  wojciechF| after clicking a thumbnail the user should see some fancy lightbox popup :)
10:59  voxpelli| Imagefield and Imagecache works great together - use Imagecache to create the thumbnails - can be done from within a Views field
10:59          --> BigMack83 has joined
10:59          --> pkuhad has joined
11:00  voxpelli| wojciechF: If I remember correctly you can also choose to have the images link to the original image - that link can be intercepted by a lightbox style javascript
11:00  wojciechF| ok, i'll try that
11:01  wojciechF| i also need receive that listings in form of AMF to process it by Flash
11:02          --> manuee has joined
11:03  voxpelli| if you're lucky you will get that for free - might be that you have to do some tricks but hopefully not
11:03  voxpelli| Views for Services isn't as advanced as it should be - we're working on fixing it
11:04          --> nescius has joined

11:08  wojciechF| can you tell me please, may I use views services API to gather a listing of nodes that are children of some node?
11:08          <-- smultron has quit irc
11:09  voxpelli| wojciechF: If there's an argument for specifying such a thing - then yes
11:09          <-- macode has quit irc
11:10  voxpelli| wojciechF: The only limitation of Views for Services should be the complexity of the output data - not the input data
11:11  wojciechF| i don't need complex output data
11:11  wojciechF| It seems that there is still a lot to learn for me, and it's obvious
11:12  wojciechF| hope to reach proficiency in Drupal (using and development) one day :)
11:12  wojciechF| so far I can just study, study, study and donate project from time to time, as I think developers deserve that
11:12  voxpelli| :) you probably will - it's hard to get started but once you get used to it it's quite easy
11:12          <-- hija has quit irc
11:13  wojciechF| is there any way to retrieve dependancy information from Drupal?
11:14  voxpelli| module dependency?
11:14  wojciechF| nodes dependency
11:14  wojciechF| or there is no such thing, except the menu
11:14  wojciechF| i think I have to switch my brain to the new track of thinking :)
11:14  voxpelli| normally nodes aren't dependent on each other - might exist some module that creates such a behaviour though
11:15          --> siva has joined
11:15  wojciechF| I feel that the best option is to learn to use Taxonomy
11:15          <-- gregeh has quit irc
11:15  wojciechF| to mimic dependencies
11:16          --> macode has joined
11:17  voxpelli| yeah - it's probably the best
11:18  voxpelli| CCK:s Node references might be good sometimes as well
11:20  wojciechF| as I said before, I need to build a Gallery with subtopics, and each subtopic needs to have a list of images with author name, and some short description
11:20  wojciechF| clicking an image should open bigger version of an image
11:20          --> kenpark has joined
11:21  wojciechF| do you think I should create a new content type for a gallery image with fields like: image_title, author, image_url etc.?
11:22  wojciechF| hope I'm not too much "pushy person"
11:22  voxpelli| a new node type for gallery images sounds good

11:54  AstroMix| using forms api how does one go about putting in an image upload field for the user picture?
11:55  AstroMix| found this: not sure if it's for d6 or not
11:55  AstroMix| http://www.akchauhan.com/create-image-upload-field-using-drupal-form-api/
11:55  AstroMix| but I figure this can be handled through the default submit handler somehow
11:56  AstroMix| $form['user_picture'] maybe?
11:56  AstroMix| i'm just not sure what to pass along there
11:59  dekita| AstroMix: if you enable user pictures in admin > user > settings drupal will add a picture field to the profile form for you

13:15  Graloth| shlomi: yeah, i tried the permissions, it works like i want but it displays some strange numbers (and letters) in random order at the very top of the site and the bottom (before the doctype in the sourceode), and i have no idea why drupal does this (its a clean drupal install, no other modules activated yet)

13:34  dbabbage| Well anyway, you can import any content type easily... if you get it to output the right format. Hmm, wondering if that is a core drupal functionality in my site or whether the Content Type importing option is being supplied by contrib. Not sure! But I imported a content type from a text-based description as recently as this morning.

13:42  dbabbage| aiwata55: See also http://drupal.org/taxonomy/term/90
13:43  nimzie| kthomas_vh - why not just create another content type for thngs you need and wire those up? If the core types are gone, they wouldn't be using them anyhow...
13:43  dbabbage| aiwata55: But actually I'm surprised if you can't do what you're asking just through the standard OG module. Have you checked if you've enabled any sub-modules that ship with it?
13:44  aiwata55| dbabbage: thank you for the links.

15:56  Queeq| Webwalker3D, in any case there should be some CSS file, where the particular class of UL specified...

20:12  Druplicon| Nodewords is a module that allows you to set the meta tags for your Drupal site; see http://drupal.org/project/nodewords for more information.

20:19  zeropx| Ok, so my question time. When editing a node and using PHP code in the body( because I am the only one editing ever ), is there a way to send a preprocess value that can be used inside this field? I have tried my general preprocess's and with no luck so far.

20:22  e621| ?
20:22  e621| they do.. afaik
20:22  __joel____| the text field?
20:22  e621| do you mean the body?
20:22  __joel____| the default text field that is?
20:22  mcfilms| cck fields yes
20:22  e621| you can only hyde fields you created
20:22  __joel____| well, you can hide the titls field
20:22  e621| but you can create a field, call it ''description''
20:23  e621| and through the body there
20:23  __joel____| or, you can just hide it with CSS
20:23  e621| then you can do whatever
20:23  __joel____| make it an optional field
20:23  e621| hyde, show, views, panels...
20:23  __joel____| important field is the title field since that names the node
20:24  __joel____| nibblebot ... my only suggestion is to stick with it.  Drupal is somewhat proprietary in the terms it uses, but once you get it, there's little out there that's better at being a CMS
20:24  e621| one question... I am used to recall images with views / attached images

20:24  e621| <img src="/images/biophoto.bio.png" />
20:24  e621| shows nothing.. 
20:24  __joel____| edit the input type first off
20:25  __joel____| edit the "filtered html" type to allow <img>
20:25  __joel____| that's easiest
20:25  e621| right, input mode is full html
20:25  __joel____| then your path is wrong
20:25  e621| well.. with full html should work as well..
20:25          --> umar has joined
20:25  e621| hmmm

20:25  __joel____| fine

20:25  umar| hi everyone
20:25  e621| http://mysite.com/sites/default/files/images/biophoto.bio.png
20:26  e621| works as a path
20:26  umar| how do i check if db_query has returned an empty result set or not?
20:26  __joel____| see nibblebot, i'm not a programmer at all
20:26  e621| which part should I copy in the code?
20:26  __joel____| so using contributions I can make it do just about anything
20:26  __joel____| first use it all e621
20:26          --> elijah has joined
20:26  __joel____| see if it shows up
20:26  __joel____| then pare it down to

20:27  nibblebot| as a programmer, i love this system. the fact that 75% of things you want to do have a module to handle it and another 24% can be customized without hacking core is brilliant
20:27  __joel____| I think that's the path you want ... I always make a "files" folder off the root of my site to make it easy

20:36          <-- c4rl has quit irc
20:36  mcfilms| "but then views does not show the email "  So you are not using the actual user node -- you can make THAT available to anon, just not a view with the data

20:38  AstroMix| PatMac tmp should be working, I think it's just not going through the submit handler right, basically setting 'picture' in my submit array to $form_state['values']['picture'] which doesn't seem to be correct
20:39  PatMac| oh
20:39  AstroMix| however, it isn't uploading the image either — so it isn't just that it's not saving the path to the database
20:39  mcfilms| Does a simple sitename.com/user/uid (where uid is a number) work for anon users?
20:39  PatMac| are you building a custom module?
20:39  AstroMix| yes
20:40  nitrospectide| iamjono: thx. Search Config did exactly what I needed
20:40  AstroMix| basically my client needs two different kinds of users and the way i've chosen to go about it is with hook_form_alter on the user registration form
20:40  grantkruger| mcfilms: yes
20:40  gooddesignusa| can anyone help me with some basic php and substr
20:40  iamjono| nitrospectide, awesome :)

(but then would the email field work? dunno.)

00:06  jdschroeder| itscheez: In that example, the www-data user is owner of the files folder, which has write permissions, allowing 770 (no world access). That is certainly a more secure (and more advisable) way of setting it up.
00:06  itscheez| if i "chown -R apache:apache ./*" at the drupal root will that be secure?

00:08  jdschroeder| itscheez: That will probably cause headaches when trying to edit the files on your site as any other user. I'm not sure if it poses any particular security risk. I would limit it to the files folder.

08:03  AntoineLaf| using* that is...
08:03  Graloth| is there any way to make a view that have 2 displays, one is a page and another is a block, is there a way to make the block stay "attached" to the other display (i know calendar module adds some views that does attach its displays to eachother, but i have no idea how)

08:04  foo| so I've determined tinymce is stripping <style> </style>  tags out of my wysiwyg editor. I have wysiwyg api +  tinymce. If I remove tinymce from the input format, then  <style> stays... but if I enable it, it strips <style>  and I can't get it to stop (even if I allow it with html  filter). Any thoughts?
08:05  AntoineLaf| or views_customfield?
08:05  AntoineLaf| views_customfield?
08:05  Druplicon| views_customfield is An amazing module that allows you to output PHP in Views. See http://drupal.org/project/views_customfield
08:05  AntoineLaf| and use the php block
08:05  AntoineLaf| and combine with views_embed_view and the view you want to display

10:49  Graloth| nuckwork: i think its similar to menu items, so its either -50 or 50, but it can probably be more if you have more than 100 pages
10:50  dekita| you can add more weights if needed..
10:50          --> freepenguin has joined
10:51  nuck_work| dekita: how can i do that?
10:51  nuck_work| it's limited to 15
10:51  nuck_work| D=
10:51  nuck_work| Graloth: no it's limited to -15 to +15
10:51  dekita| maybe it's special to the book module, but I added more weights to the default form weight element
10:51  Graloth| oh, dunno then
10:52  Graloth| well, if you have used all from -15 to 15, shouldnt it automatically add more if you add more pages?
10:52  dekita| using hook_element iirc
10:53          <-- smultron has quit irc
10:53          --> szczym has joined
10:53  nuck_work| the problem is that i'm using node_import to import the book
10:53  nuck_work| and that one throws errors at me, so it's not the form but the limitations of the module itself =(
10:54  nuck_work| do i really need to resort to manually substracting -15 from all imported values?
10:54  nuck_work| the book module has failed me already twice, maximum depth of 9 and maximum weight of 15 sigh
10:55  dekita| this function processes weight elements http://api.drupal.org/api/function/process_weight
10:55  dekita| I added more to it using hook_element and the $element['#delta']

10:56  nuck_work| dekita: thanks, but i don't want to hack into either the book module nor the node_import module =/
10:56          <-- sadist has quit irc
10:56  dekita| it's not a hack, it's an override
10:56  dekita| and is hook_elements, not hook_element, just found the code
10:56  seutje| hook_elements doesn't let u override previously defines ones, does it?
10:56  dekita| seutje: worked for me :)
10:57  seutje| tried that approach one to increase the default maxlength of textfields, but no dice
10:57  dekita| was for D5 and needed more weights, D6 has more by default
10:57  dekita| but should still work
10:57  jara| how to set my_variable as global variable.I want to show my_variable in blocks...how to do this...
10:57  dekita| seutje: maybe because of how process_weight works with the #delta
10:57  nuck_work| dekita: so where would i implement that code?
10:57  dekita| nuck_work: in a module
10:57  seutje| I dunno, hook_elements defines -10 to 10, book's form_alter redefines it -15 to 15
10:58  seutje| so u'll prolly have to form_alter it
10:58  nuck_work| so i need to override the book's form alter?
10:58  dekita| yeah, not sure if the book module does something special, could maybe form_alter then
10:58  nuck_work| sigh
10:58  dekita| book_form_alter?
10:58  Druplicon| book_form_alter: [Documented summary is not one line. This is a bug. File a patch!] => book_form_alter(&$form, $form_state, $form_id) => http://api.drupal.org/api/function/book_form_alter/6
10:59  dekita| yeah, it sets  '#delta' => 15,
10:59  dekita| for weight element
10:59  dekita| so we need to come in after that
10:59  dekita| *would
11:01  dekita| nuck_work: you could use a hook_form_alter in a module to add more weights if needed.
11:01          --> Roelven has joined
11:01  dekita| as per seutje's suggestion

11:04  dekita| weight is flexible in D6, no idea re: menu depth. 9 is sufficient in most cases..
11:04  dekita| except yours ;)
11:04  nuck_work| well i had to remove the uppermost book and split it into 5 books instead
11:04          --> vanillaslice has joined
11:05  nuck_work| that helped me cut it down to the needed depth
11:05  nuck_work| but it makes me cringe in agony anyway
11:05  dekita| ah ok
11:05  dekita| I might be working on a module shortly that converts office docs to books in drupal..
11:05  dekita| using docvert
11:05  nuck_work| i've seen others complain about the depth
11:06  seutje| nuck_work: think it remained similar in D7, but it's easier to override it

11:21  dekita| so can't really comment
11:22  dekita| vanillaslice: you could probably theme them out if needed
11:22  seutje| JosefAssad: the attached patch seems to have been committed to D7, but it hasn't been committed to the D6 branch yet. It's a relatively small change though

11:24  seutje| heh, there's isn't rly a "break accessibility" checkbox, no :P
11:24  vanillaslice| dekita: it's a menu item. you must fill the menu title in, when creating a page for example
11:24  vanillaslice| i think i must alter the link within code somehow
11:25  dekita| heh, you mean the menu link text? that's a different story...
11:25  vanillaslice| oh
11:25  vanillaslice| <a href=""  TITLE="This text should not appear"></a>
11:25  vanillaslice| i mean this title
11:25  dekita| do you know what the "title" attribute is?
11:25  nuck_work| as i thought, looks like overriding book_form_alter only works for actual forms
11:25  nuck_work| not the module itself
11:25  nuck_work| D=
11:25  dekita| oh, ok that's the title attr yeah

11:27  dekita| nuck_work: that doesn't make sense to me.. :-/
11:27  JosefAssad| seutje: I would prefer a drupal upgrade rather than doing it myself givn the database surgery, but yeah the patch itself is small
11:27  vanillaslice| dekita: yes - but i am using translations.. the title tag is showing what the English title is (original title tag when apge was created) ..so i just want to disable them all together
11:28  dekita| vanillaslice: I see, maybe you could wrap them in t() in theme_menu_item_link and get the translation.
11:28  seutje| vanillaslice, dekita:  it uses $link['localized_options']['attributes']['title'] which u can easily override in theme_menu_item_link
11:28  dekita| seutje: yeah, that was my first suggestion
11:28          --> OVIDYOU has joined
11:29  nuck_work| dekita: well node_import does not seem to be in any way influenced by the module, but when i manually check the book page form it shows up properly

11:29  seutje| JosefAssad: there is 0 database surgery involved in this patch

14:26  g10tto| skh_: can't access the /?q=user page because it times out

15:37  AstroMix| hey G_S each different block you have is supposed to be a different node type?
15:37  frankie_2304| seutje: yes
15:37  skh_| frankie_2304: do you have body classse.. eg. page-front, page-primlink1, page-primlink2,.. if you do you can use that to isolate the 'active' link
15:37          --> keystr0k has joined
15:38          <-- geo27_ has quit irc
15:38  skh_| or even section-x may be more useful
15:38  G_S| no, same type but that content type contains a field called "Page" which decides which page that content is published to
15:38  nuck_work| wsod?
15:38  Druplicon| wsod is a blank page, the so called "White Screen Of Death". See http://drupal.org/node/158043 for possible causes.
15:38  frankie_2304| skh_: yes i have a body class

15:39  skh_| frankie_2304: do you have a url?  i can give you a specific answer rather than a generic one

15:42  enginpost| skh_: yes. using node reference.  And on the summary line, I have info like, product name and price
15:42  enginpost| skh_: I want to include the last "review" cck node title in that row as well
15:43  enginpost| skh_: just the last one
15:44  seutje| frankie_2304: hmm, it's definitely not the theme, out of the box, acquia marina doesn't override it
15:44  nmsss| Anyone used simpleviewer with SWF Tools? Having issues
15:44  enginpost| skh_: I figured I could use the reference field as the "relationship" and add the Title field from "Reviews" using that relationship
15:44  enginpost| skh_: but nothing ever shows up in that column
15:44  frankie_2304| seutje: it's working for only one link/button out of 5

15:52  iamjon| can anyone help me implement the suggestion in this post to remove the submit button on a form and have it submitted with enter instead http://www.starbowconsulting.com/blog/tao/form-without-submit-button
15:52  seutje| /foo/bar would make /foo in the active trail
15:53          --> voxpelli has joined
15:53  iamjon| when i get rid of the submit in the form api it doesn't submit
15:53  iamjon| and making the button hidden in css kills ie
15:53  seutje| foo/bar/baz/meh/bla would have an active trail of foo/bar/baz/meh, foo/bar/baz, foo/bar and foo

15:59  iamjon| seutje, first of all, thank you, you're the awesom-ist! i've tried a couple of things. right now in my css it's display none, but i also tried to #value: hidden (i think or something to the extent in) using a custom module...which worked to make it hidden but it wouldn't submit anywhere

16:01  iamjon| ie8 as well. I really wanted to do in my custom module, but haven't figured it out.
16:01          -#- RockSoup_ is known as RockSoup
16:01  seutje| so no longer a type="submit"
16:02  seutje| I think visibility: hidden; should work
16:02  seutje| but that would prolly still make it take up space
16:02          --> HenryLTV has joined
16:02  seutje| so u might have to go all height:0; width: 0; overflow: hidden; or something
16:02  iamjon| let me give it a go in the css...but is there a custom module way of having forms with out submit buttons?
16:02  seutje| (margin: 0; padding: 0; ...
16:03  seutje| not rly kosher to have forms without a submit button imo
16:03  nitrospectide| anyone know how to write a custom Views filter?

16:04          <-- ajpiano has quit irc
16:04          <-- malkineRage has quit irc
16:04  seutje| another way is {position: absolute; left: -999em;}
16:04  iamjon| seutje, i completey agree...but us webmonkeys are given a sketch and must make it work if it was up to me there would be a button
16:04  seutje| but that will make IE7 go all funky and give u this huge looking button so u'll have to add width: 0
16:04          --> darrenoh has joined
16:05  seutje| iamjon: orrrrr, u could only hide the button when js is enabled and bind certain events to trigger the submit
16:05  seutje| (suppressing the default behaviour to prevent double-submits on anything other than IE)
16:05  iamjon| that sounds like fun! how do i that?
16:06  WormFood| A customer adds some bad php code, because you thought they could handle having that much power over their site, and while although they have a database backup, they can't get to the page to restore the database, because of their bad code.....is there a way for them to restore their backup, without calling you for help? (I figured out how, I want to see if there is a "drupal way" to do this)

16:07  iamjon| seutje, one sec, trying right now :)
16:08  seutje| then like if (e.keyCode == '29') { $(this).closest('form').trigger('submit'); } return false;
16:08  seutje| or w/e is enter

16:09  WormFood| iamjon, how can they get to backup migrate page, if their bad php code takes down the site?
