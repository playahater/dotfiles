22:12  fopah| they are all different! from each other
22:12  Gorau| well then choose the one that is correct
22:12  Ebonwumon| I don't suppose any of you play the guitar?
22:13  mikhailgrigri| exactly, gorau gets it
22:13  mikhailgrigri| and i sort of play it, why?
22:13  Gorau| that depends on your definition of "play"
22:14  Ebonwumon| If a tab says G 4/5 in the same column as it says D 4/5 was does it mean?
22:14  Ebonwumon| Are you supposed to play both of them at the same time?
22:14  mikhailgrigri| yeah
22:14  Ebonwumon| damn
22:14  mikhailgrigri| lol
22:14  Ebonwumon| that makes my life harder.
22:14  mikhailgrigri| yes, yes it does
22:14          * Ebonwumon is trying to translate a guitar tab to ukulele
22:14  Ebonwumon| I programmed a php app to do it, but it choked up there.
22:15  mikhailgrigri| lol
22:15  mikhailgrigri| wait
22:15  mikhailgrigri| ...you mean to tell me you play ukulele, and NOT guitar? o.o
22:15  Ebonwumon| This is correct.
22:15  mikhailgrigri| i thought it was usually the other way around
22:16  Ebonwumon| Real men play the uke.
22:16  mikhailgrigri| true
22:16  mikhailgrigri| i bought a ukulele, but only bother playing it when drunk.
22:17  Ebonwumon| My girlfriend had 3 in her basement so I just stole one.
22:17  Ebonwumon| It's a fun thing to play.
22:17  Ebonwumon| I'm not really musically knowledgable though.
22:17  Ebonwumon| People tell be about scales and octaves and I just reply with "wtf are those things"
22:17  Gorau| scales are things fish have right?
22:18  mikhailgrigri| oh i have no idea either
22:18  mikhailgrigri| i just find a song i like with a lot of different guitar tunes in it, learn the tabs to the song, and string together the tunes
22:18  mikhailgrigri| fun enough :)
22:18          --> timkurvers has joined
22:19  timkurvers| \o/
22:19  Ebonwumon| My problem is one of my favourite songs is very guitar heavy.
22:19  Ebonwumon| And no one's translated it to uke that's willing to publish their information.
22:19  mikhailgrigri| what song?
22:19  Ebonwumon| Overkill.
22:19  mikhailgrigri| ive found that all songs are either too easy or too hard for the guitar, lol
22:19  Ebonwumon| The colin hay acoustic one though
22:20  mikhailgrigri| like rodrigo gabriela, insane
22:20  Ebonwumon| Not the old men at work one
22:20  mikhailgrigri| let me look it up
22:20  mikhailgrigri| ah
22:20  mikhailgrigri| overkill
22:21  Ebonwumon| I've got about a fifth of the solo down, but it's a real bitch when it's telling me to play two strings at once and if I"m translating all the notes to uke, those strings are on opposite sides.
22:21  Ebonwumon| And it's not physically possible to do without taking some liberties with the notes.
22:22  mikhailgrigri| ah, makes sense
22:22  mikhailgrigri| well, you can always improvise the sound
22:26  timkurvers| you could.. buy a monkey
22:26  timkurvers| to handle the string on the opposite side of the spectrum >.>
22:26  Ebonwumon| FLAWLESS LOGIC!
22:27  timkurvers| I kno raight.
22:27  timkurvers| should be fairly easy, using some Monkey Island II strategies, to HI-JACK the monkey even
22:27  Gorau| Owner_: / is used to make the weight of a path to a node an attribute of this node
22:28  Owner_| an attribute?
22:29  Gorau| attribute maybe the wrong term
22:30  Gorau| but i don't know what else to use
22:31  Gorau| and this is what i managed to figure out, i could of course be wrong :(  but it seems to make sense at least in my little world

23:25  Octember| Hello, world
23:25  Octember| Anyone here?
23:26  kyles0623| Congratulations. You have been selected to win a free ipod nano.
23:26  timkurvers| hides
23:26  fopah| i really would like an ipod nano
23:27  Xeno___| I have one. They're not particularly good.
23:28  Xeno___| If you were a local I'd trade it for a minecraft key :p
23:29  timkurvers| haha
23:29  fopah| ive never played minecraft
23:35  Octember| Minecraft deeply concerns me
23:41  fopah| i avoid all games that will take me away from work time
23:41  fopah| almost got civilization 4
23:41  fopah| dodged that bullet
23:43  Xeno___| If there ever showed up another game in the vein of Privateer 2: The Darknening; it'd be my undoing.
23:48  Gorau| i don't enjoy games anymore :( coding is much more fun
23:48  fopah| I don't really play games anymore. I have all the consoles O_o
23:48  fopah| screw being grown up
23:49  Gorau| i don't have any consoles
23:49  Xeno___| I have an x360 that I never use
23:49          --> vin has joined
23:49  Gorau| well maybe N64 is stil in attic back home
23:49  fopah| coulda saved me a few hundred dollars cause i play like 2 games and they are virtual console titles on the wii
23:50  Xeno___| Hm
23:50  Xeno___| I should still have my SNES around here somewhere
23:50  Gorau| i have a SNES back home too, but somehow no cables
23:50  fopah| they don't make single player games that don't take 50 hours anymore
23:50  fopah| i wanna sit down for like 30 mins play the game then quit
23:51  Xeno___| Don't you mean the opposite? :p
23:51  Xeno___| SP games today take 4-5 hours from start to finish.
23:51  kyles0623| I'm looking for a N64 with Tony Hawk Pro Skate
23:51  Gorau| i never had that game
23:51          <-- jmombo has quit irc
23:52  fopah| thps was my favorite ps game
23:52  Gorau| Star Fox or whatever it was called and the star wars racing game was all that was needed
23:52  Gorau| oh and perfect dark and banjo kazooie
23:52  Xeno___| Star Wars Pod Racing ran great on my 486 DX4 ^^
23:52  fopah| Brag: I work with a guy that worked on goldeneye/perfect dark
23:53  Xeno___| I only played goldeneye once :<
23:53  Gorau| oh goldeneye is another one

23:59  Xeno___| quick question, just installed python, how does python do powers? is it ^?

00:00  Phenax| Hmm
00:00  Phenax| isn't it **?
00:00  Xeno___| oh, cheers
00:00  Phenax| Yeah, it most languages ^ is a bitwise xor
00:01  Xeno___| figured I'd make a quick commandline IP to base10 converter as a first test
00:01  Phenax| Looks at the bits in two numbers (0s and 1s) and then returns 1 if the two binary numbers are 0 and 1 -- returns 0 if the two binary numbers are 1 and 1 or 0 and 0
00:02  Xeno___| what's a practical use of xor? :p
00:02  Phenax| If you do x^y^y you get x
00:02  Phenax| So you can swap numbers without a intermediate variable
00:03  Phenax| but on modern compilers usually it's not good for performance
00:03          <-- sigveseb has quit irc
00:03  Xeno___| ah, so basically cutting down memory usage and cycles for really tight algos?
00:03  Phenax| Maybe on really old embedded systems
00:03  Xeno___| or is it a legacy feature?
00:03  Phenax| nah, its just the way bitwise works
00:03  Phenax| xor
00:04          --> sigveseb has joined
00:04  Phenax| http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html
00:04  Phenax| lots of obscure and generally not worth using ways to do things with bitwise functions
00:04  Phenax| lol
00:04  Phenax| bbl

00:08  snowmanchu| if you want to multiply by 10 you can just do a bitwise shift
00:13  Owner_| by 10 in base 10?
00:13  Owner_| Goldeneye was fun :)
00:14  fopah| i never had a 64 :(  so I don't have a full appreciation
00:16  timkurvers1| it sure was owner

00:18          --> m1ss1ontomars has joined
00:22  Xeno___| snowmanchu: wouldn't a bitwise shift double, or halve the value?
00:22  Xeno___| instead of multiplying by 10?
00:23  timkurvers1| he might have meant multiply by binary 10 (which would be 2)
00:23  Xeno___| or bitwise shift and what I'm talking about are two separate things. I usually get things mixed up ;D
00:23  timkurvers1| no you're correct afaik
00:24  m1ss1ontomars| mhmm
00:24  timkurvers1| I do believe that's what Owner was aiming at as well, whether he meant multiplying by 10 in base 10, or by 10 in base 2
00:24  Xeno___| I got something right! This calls for a celebratory cup of tea :3

00:25  timkurvers1| the fail's on me. sits in corner instead
00:27  snowmanchu| yeah it is multiplication by 2

02:54  Phenax| Finally got my code working
02:55  Phenax| Three days of a couple hours a day to make some polygon handling functions/structs and then a method to generate it into a character/tilemap for my dungeon crawler :)
02:55  Phenax| Polygons are congegated inside of a "level" and then you can turn the level into a character map. I figure it'd be easier to deal with procedural generation when using polygons

03:14  Phenax| Probably going to work with SDL later down the rode but I'm mostly working on foundation stuff
03:15  Phenax| I've been considering heavily using Python though, I hear it's easy to integrate Python into C and vice versa
03:44          <-- Mikaboshi has quit irc
03:45  snowmanchu| yeah apparently python has a header file that you can include into c
