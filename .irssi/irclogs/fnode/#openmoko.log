11:45  Psi| does gta02 have the same bug as gta01 where if you suspend the phone while on charge it eventually runs totally flat
11:46  Psi| in shr, i should say
11:47  PaulFertser| Psi: no
11:47  Psi| ok
11:47  PaulFertser| Psi: do you have an idea how that might happen?
11:47          <-- ColdFyre has quit irc
11:48  Psi| it seems to last longer than normal, so i think it is charging, just not enough to keep the bat topped up
11:48  PaulFertser| Psi: i see this scenario: you suspend the phone, it charges the battery until full, then stops charging, the battery starts discharging slowly but steadily until flat. But it should take a lot of time since only gsm is powered directly by the bettery.
11:48  Psi| my phone bat was at around 60% (dont know exactly, just from what the icon looked like) after around 24h suspended on charge
11:49  Psi| it was fully charged at the start
11:49  Psi| phone would never last 24hours suspended if it wasnt on charge
11:49  Psi| would probably last 12 or so
11:50  Psi| although, ive not done a test to check that for a while
11:50  Psi| does the phone need to wake up to turn charge back on? or should it happen automatically
11:51  Psi| it may have something to do with what i said a few months back, that gta01 never seems to stop charging, charge icon is always on
11:51  Psi| i remember you thought that was wrong, and it should dissapear once the bat was full
11:52  PaulFertser| Psi: hm
11:53  PaulFertser| DocScrutinizer: do you have an idea? I thought 500mA is pretty much enough to run gta01 from usb. What's weird here is that it flats the battery even suspended...
11:53          <-- dns53 has quit irc
11:54  DocScrutinizer| sounds weird
11:54  DocScrutinizer| lemme scan backscroll
11:55          --> naeg has joined
11:58  valos| alabd: paired with another device ? do you sppeak about bluetooth devices ?
11:58  DocScrutinizer| I think it's a) not really suspended and hogs power, or b) PMU is configured incorrectly
11:58  Psi| ok
11:58  PaulFertser| DocScrutinizer: in my testing suspended gta01 really charged the battery.
11:58  DocScrutinizer| Psi: usually PMU chip should restart charge when battery is some 70% down
11:59  PaulFertser| DocScrutinizer: not the case for pcf50606 i'm afraid.
11:59  Psi| its possible i didnt wait long enough
11:59  DocScrutinizer| PaulFertser: ouch!!
11:59  PaulFertser| DocScrutinizer: yeah, i think i tried hard to find the feature but looks like it's not there.
11:59  Psi| so phone needs to wake up every so often to check?
12:00  Psi| im pondering getting a n900
12:01  Psi| anyone else in here got one?
12:01  PaulFertser| Basically, yes. But in RL you'll rarely leave the phone for so long plugged in continuesly. It should be 120 hours straight to drain the battery with only GSM.
12:01  Psi| true
12:02  DocScrutinizer| yep, your figure of only 12h in suspend doesn't sound correct
12:02  Psi| ok, its been a while since i did that test, ill do another one

12:28  alabd_| valos: Paired': True,
12:28  alabd_|     'Trusted': False,
12:29  valos| alabd_: in device properties, you will see the laptop name in field name
12:29  alabd_| yes
12:30  alabd_| how to make it trusted
12:30  valos| alabd_: and next look at paired and trusted
12:30  valos| alabd_: you can use simple-agent or emtooth
12:31  valos| alabd_: http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Manually_using_Bluetooth#Pairing_2
12:31  alabd_| emtooth can not make it trusted choice is not accessable
12:31  PaulFertser| I' not 
12:31  PaulFertser| I'm not sure it must be trusted to work.
12:31  valos| alabd_: http://code.google.com/p/emtooth/ but I don't know if it works under shr-testing
12:32  alabd_| am afraid at all what should be done except pairig 
12:32  alabd_| emtooth worked but 
12:32  alabd_| can not make it trusted choice is not accessable
12:34  alabd_| maybe reading wiki should make sense 
12:36  alabd_| is this step required for shr-testing ?
12:36  alabd_| http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Manually_using_Bluetooth#State_file
12:37  alabd_| PaulFertser:  valos it is trusted now with emtooth
12:37  PaulFertser| alabd_: no, you've already has the right statfile.
12:37  alabd_| ok thanks 
12:38  alabd_| how about   Rules file   PaulFertser
12:39  PaulFertser| alabd_: you need to alter that according to the wiki.
