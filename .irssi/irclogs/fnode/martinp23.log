This is the only global notice we'll send about the new year celebrations - further messages will be sent using wallops - do /umode +w to see them (and if you want to join the party, /j #freenode-newyears). Thanks for flying freenode over 2010 and here's to 2011!

18:57 -Martinp23(martinp23@freenode/staff/wikimedia.martinp23)- [Global Notice] Hi folks! As you'll have noticed, we just lost about half the network due to hub issues. We're trying to put together what we can! Thanks for your patience.

21:04 -Martinp23(martinp23@freenode/staff/wikimedia.martinp23)- [Global Notice] Hi everyone. You will have possibly noticed some instability on the network earlier this evening. The network is under a sustained DDoS and so lag and possible further splits are to be expected. We apologise for the inconvenience - our fantastic sponsorship and infra teams are working to minimise the further impact. Have a nice evening!

22:06 -Martinp23(martinp23@freenode/staff/martinp23)- [Global Notice] Hi everyone! Just a bit of re-routing there which will hopefully reduce lag in parts of the network and make the layout a bit more sane. Sorry for the noise! Join #freenode with any questions.
